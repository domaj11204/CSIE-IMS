The automatic differentiation of syndromes of unstructured medical records requires two important steps: Chinese word segmentation and text classification. Due to the ambiguity of the Chinese language and the peculiarities of syndrome differentiation, these tasks pose a daunting challenge. We use text classification to model syndrome differentiation for TCM, and use multi-task learning (MTL) and deep learning to accomplish the two challenging tasks of Chinese word segmentation and syndrome differentiation. Two classic deep neural networks—bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) and text-based convolutional neural networks (TextCNN)—are fused into MTL to simultaneously carry out these two tasks. We used our proposed method to conduct a large number of comparative experiments. The experimental comparisons showed that it was superior to other methods on both tasks. Our model yielded values of accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity of 0.93, 0.94, and 0.90, and 0.80, 0.82, and 0.78 on the Chinese word segmentation task and the syndrome differentiation task, respectively. Moreover, statistical analyses showed that the accuracies of the non-joint and joint models were both within the 95% confidence interval, with pvalue < 0.05. The experimental comparison showed that our method is superior to prevalent methods on both tasks.

Additionally, we proposed a novel method to combine deep learning text representation with TCM domain knowledge, which results in the best classification performance.","2016-12-01","2022-08-03 06:59:49","2024-03-26 15:26:05","2022-08-03 06:59:49","1926-1928","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Computer Society","","English","","","","","www.computer.org","","6 citations (Crossref) [2024-03-26] abstractTranslation:  文本分類是文本挖掘的基本任務之一。在醫學領域，已經有許多關於現代醫學英文臨床筆記文本分類的研究。然而，對中文臨床記錄，特別是中醫臨床記錄進行的文本分類研究非常有限。本研究的目的是研究中醫臨床文本分類的特徵和機器學習分類算法。我們收集了 7,037 名名中醫的中醫臨床記錄作為我們的數據集，並研究了不同類型特徵和分類算法的效果。此外，我們提出了一種將深度學習文本表示與中醫領域知識相結合的新方法，從而獲得最佳的分類性能。 titleTranslation: 使用知識驅動的文檔嵌入進行中醫臨床記錄分類","","C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\G2FZXGTK\Liang Yao 等。 - 2016 - Traditional Chinese medicine clinical records clas.pdf","","深度學習; 中醫; 機器學習; 詞向量; 病歷分析; 原始碼; 病歷分類; embedded","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2016 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"SFLPS7MT","thesis","","邱奕傑","BERT 模型於中文誘餌式標題可解釋性之研究","","","","","","自然語言處理領域 (Natural Language Processing, NLP) 隨著機器學習(Machine Learning, ML) 與深度學習 (Deep Learning, DL) 的迅速發展，在許多任務上都得到了卓越的改善。誘餌式標題任務 (Clickbait) 在NLP中被視為一項重要任務，定義為在網路上故意用較為誇大、聳動、不實的文章標題以吸引網友點擊觀看的文章，像是常見的網路標題：「看完後我驚呆了！」、「全世界百萬人瘋傳，大家都驚呆了」、「面對記者的瘋狂追問，他竟這麼說」，主要是網路新媒體業想吸引大眾目光，獲得曝光度與點閱量，透過點閱量賺取廣告收益常採用的方法。在中文誘餌式標題任務中，常採用的ML與DL方法非常依賴人工特徵以及循環神經網路記憶長期資訊，無法準確學習到任務的內部特徵，導致模型分類準確率並不高，且模型不具有可解釋性 (Explainable AI, XAI)。XAI關心模型下判斷的理由，當模型的判斷會對使用者的生活造成重大影響，使用者卻無法得知判斷理由與信任模型時，模型將會百無一用。本論文以改善中文誘餌式任務準確度與證實模型具有可解釋性為目標，使用預訓練BERT模型搭配線性分類器與改善BERT輸入限制等問題，提升模型準確率；利用可視化注意力工具BertViz觀察模型內部權重，針對模型的XAI進行研究，證實模型具有可解釋性。","","2022-07-26 09:18:47","2022-10-27 09:02:43","","","","","","","","","","","","","國立中正大學","嘉義縣","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In recent years, to compose medical records in Chinese has increased demand since most patients are not aware of English medical terms. While composing a medical records in Chinese, several problems may arise: 1)input method of Chinese is not quick enough; 2)wasted too much time when writing of chief complaint; 3)not accurate translation of medical vocabulary; 4)the grammatical structure is very different. The goal of this paper is to construct a system for chief complaint composing with sentence pattern prediction. Two major modules are developed in this study: 1) chief complaint collection and construction module: to setup original chief complaint corpus, parallel corpus, medical keywords corpus, POS-based corpus, Class-based corpus; 2) data analysis and chief complaints prediction module: bi-gram language model, POS-based bi-gram language model, class-based bi-gram language model and Partial Sentence Tree Model. By integrating of the above modules, chief complaints composition supporting system with friendly input interface, sentence prediction function and chief complaints translation function was built. Several experiments and assessment of the effectiveness of the system was carried out. The experimental results showed that the Keystrokes and composing time of chief complaint composition are improved by adapting the proposed approach. It encourages us that the proposed system can be utilized on chief complaints composing and will be helpful in reducing the burden of medical staffs.","2011-01","2022-08-14 07:16:18","2023-09-13 11:35:26","2022-08-14 07:16:18","","1-65","","","","","","","","","","長榮大學","","zh_CN","","Master's Thesis","","","Airiti","","Issue: 2011年 Publication Title: 長榮大學資訊管理學系(所)學位論文 DOI: 10.6833/CJCU.2011.00194 abstractTranslation:  病歷摘要是繼作為醫病構通橋樑的重要藉鑑，撰寫中文化病歷摘要近年來衛生署為了提升病患對自身疾病的「知的權利」進行推廣之。有時會遇到問題，如：1）中文輸入速度不夠快；2）編寫耗費時間過多；3）醫療文書難以明確翻譯成中文表達；4）中文法律架構差異甚遠，轉譯時容易產生文書等。研究目的為針對病歷摘要主訴，制定了一套供書寫以撰寫中文化病歷摘要主訴句時，參考之書撰稿建議系統，其功能包括醫療用語中文化輔助翻譯及主訴式書寫預測提醒。其特定目標包括：（1）徵集並建置醫療商標申請中英平行語庫，包含：病歷主訴資料的文字語料庫、中英平行語料庫、病歷主訴資料的文字語料庫、病歷主訴資料的文字語料庫、病歷主訴資料的文字語料庫、POS式（詞性） ）平行語料庫、基於類別的平行語料庫等工作；（2）數據分析與句型預測模型的建立：包含詞彙對照Bi-gram語言模型、基於POS的Bi-gram語言模型、基於類別的Bi-gram語言模型模型以及偏句樹模型；(3)建置病歷主訴撰寫介面；(4)系統評估。本研究整合上述方法與模組，開發出一套病歷主訴撰寫系統，包括病歷主訴撰寫介面、句型預測模組副程序與中文翻譯模組副程序等子程序。並進行系統成果評估，主要測試系統的輸入成功及輸出之正確性。實驗結果顯示，用戶使用基於POS的Bigram下一個詞提示功能對於中文主命令編寫時的擊鍵數與構句時間能有小幅改善；而使用完整的預測語句模型時，能有效降低輸入之擊鍵數與構句時間，減少主命令編寫時的繪圖時間與人力。病歷是溝通病情的重要信息。近年來，由於大多數患者不了解英文醫學術語，因此用中文撰寫病歷的需求不斷增加。在用中文書寫病歷時，可能會出現以下幾個問題：1）中文輸入法不夠快捷； 2）寫主訴浪費了太多時間； 3）醫學詞彙翻譯不准確； 4）語法結構差異很大。本文的目標是構建一個基於句型預測的主訴撰寫系統。本研究開發了兩大模塊：1）主訴採集與構建模塊：建立原始主訴語料庫、平行語料庫、醫學關鍵詞語料庫、詞性語料庫、類別語料庫； 2）數據分析和主訴預測模塊：二元語言模型、基於POS的二元語言模型、基於類別的二元語言模型和部分句子樹模型。通過對上述模塊的整合，構建了具有友好輸入界面、句子預測功能和主訴翻譯功能的主訴作文支撐系統。對系統的有效性進行了多次實驗和評估。實驗結果表明，採用該方法後主訴作文的擊鍵次數和撰寫時間得到了改善。這使我們感到鼓舞，所提出的系統可以用於主訴的撰寫，將有助於減輕醫務人員的負擔。 titleTranslation: 醫療主訴句型預測及中文詞翻譯之研究","","C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\WU5ULA3L\醫療主訴句型預測及中文詞翻譯之研究_doi.zip; C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\LX4IDM6C\醫療主訴句型預測及中文詞翻譯之研究.pdf; C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\JUUPZ8YQ\alDetailedMesh1.html","","","病歷主訴; 語言模型; Chief complaint; language model; partial sentence tree; Partial Sentence Tree; POS-based bi-gram; POS-based Bi-gram","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Information and communication technologies, such as the platform for integrated research and academic work with responsibility (PILAR), which records information about research projects, such as titles, summaries, and keywords in their various modalities, have gained relevance and importance in the management of these. We proved algorithms with these records of research projects that have been analysed in this study, and predictions were made for each of the nine (09) models of unsupervised machine learning algorithms that were implemented for each of the 7430 records from the dataset. The most efficient way of extracting keywords for this dataset was the TF-IDF method, obtaining 72% accuracy and [0.4786, SD 0.0501] in average extraction time for each thesis file processed by this model.","2022","2022-09-19 01:00:13","2023-11-28 02:21:01","2022-09-19 01:00:13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","","","","DOI.org (Datacite)","","0 citations (Semantic Scholar/arXiv) [2022-10-26] Publisher: arXiv Version Number: 1","","","","","FOS: Computer and information sciences; Information Retrieval (cs.IR)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It differs from most previous approaches mainly in three respects. First, while theoretical linguists have defined Chinese words using various linguistic criteria, Chinese words in this study are defined pragmatically as segmentation units whose definition depends on how they are used and processed in realistic computer applications. Second, we propose a pragmatic mathematical framework in which segmenting known words and detecting unknown words of different types (i.e., morphologically derived words, factoids, named entities, and other unlisted words) can be performed simultaneously in a unified way. These tasks are usually conducted separately in other systems. Finally, we do not assume the existence of a universal word segmentation standard that is application-independent. Instead, we argue for the necessity of multiple segmentation standards due to the pragmatic fact that different natural language processing applications might require different granularities of Chinese words.             These pragmatic approaches have been implemented in an adaptive Chinese word segmenter, called MSRSeg, which will be described in detail. It consists of two components: (1) a generic segmenter that is based on the framework of linear mixture models and provides a unified approach to the five fundamental features of word-level Chinese language processing: lexicon word processing, morphological analysis, factoid detection, named entity recognition, and new word identification; and (2) a set of output adaptors for adapting the output of (1) to different application-specific standards. Evaluation on five test sets with different standards shows that the adaptive system achieves state-of-the-art performance on all the test sets.","2005-12","2022-09-19 01:00:13","2024-03-26 15:15:50","2022-09-19 01:00:13","531-574","","4","31","","Computational Linguistics","Chinese Word Segmentation and Named Entity Recognition","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","120 citations (Crossref) [2024-03-26] 220 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2022-10-26] abstractTranslation:  本文提出了一種實用的中文分詞方法。它與大多數以前的方法主要在三個方面有所不同。首先，雖然理論語言學家使用各種語言標准定義了中文單詞，但本研究中的中文單詞實際上被定義為分段單元，其定義取決於它們在實際計算機應用中的使用和處理方式。其次，我們提出了一個實用的數學框架，在該框架中，可以以統一的方式同時執行已知單詞的分割和不同類型的未知單詞（即形態派生單詞、事實、命名實體和其他未列出單詞）的檢測。這些任務通常在其他系統中單獨執行。最後，我們不假設存在獨立於應用程序的通用分詞標準。相反，我們認為多種分割標準的必要性，因為不同的自然語言處理應用程序可能需要不同的中文單詞粒度。這些實用方法已在稱為 MSRSeg 的自適應中文分詞器中實現，我們將對其進行詳細描述。它由兩個組件組成：（1）一個基於線性混合模型框架的通用分段器，為詞級中文語言處理的五個基本特徵提供統一的方法：詞典詞處理、形態分析、事實檢測、命名實體識別、新詞識別； (2)一組輸出適配器，用於使(1)的輸出適應不同的特定應用標準。對五個不同標準的測試集的評估表明，自適應系統在所有測試集上都實現了最先進的性能。 titleTranslation: 中文分詞和命名實體識別：一種實用的方法","","C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\8IQWTDN6\Gao 等。 - 2005 - Chinese Word Segmentation and Named Entity Recogni.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The modernization of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) demands systematic data mining using medical records. However, this process is hindered by the fact that many TCM symptoms have the same meaning but different literal expressions (i.e., TCM synonymous symptoms). This problem can be solved by using natural language processing algorithms to construct a high-quality TCM symptom normalization model for normalizing TCM synonymous symptoms to unified literal expressions. Methods. Four types of TCM symptom normalization models, based on natural language processing, were constructed to find a high-quality one: (1) a text sequence generation model based on a bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) neural network with an encoder-decoder structure; (2) a text classification model based on a Bi-LSTM neural network and sigmoid function; (3) a text sequence generation model based on bidirectional encoder representation from transformers (BERT) with sequence-to-sequence training method of unified language model (BERT-UniLM); (4) a text classification model based on BERT and sigmoid function (BERT-Classification). The performance of the models was compared using four metrics: accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-score. Results. The BERT-Classification model outperformed the models based on Bi-LSTM and BERT-UniLM with respect to the four metrics. Conclusions. The BERT-Classification model has superior performance in normalizing expressions of TCM synonymous symptoms.","2021-10-11","2022-09-19 00:41:30","2024-03-26 15:15:58","2022-09-19 00:41:29","1-12","","","2021","","Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","2 citations (Crossref) [2024-03-26] 1 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2022-10-26] titleTranslation: 中醫同義症狀表達規範化的自然語言處理算法 abstractTranslation:  背景。中醫現代化需要利用病歷進行系統的數據挖掘。然而，這一過程受到許多中醫症狀具有相同含義但字面表達不同（即中醫同義症狀）這一事實的阻礙。該問題可以通過利用自然語言處理算法構建高質量的中醫症狀歸一化模型，將中醫同義症狀歸一化為統一的文字表達來解決。方法。為了找到高質量的模型，構建了四種基於自然語言處理的中醫症狀歸一化模型：（1）基於雙向長短期記憶（Bi-LSTM）神經網絡的文本序列生成模型，編碼器-解碼器結構； (2)基於Bi-LSTM神經網絡和sigmoid函數的文本分類模型； （3）基於Transformer雙向編碼器表示（BERT）的文本序列生成模型，採用統一語言模型（BERT-UniLM）的序列到序列訓練方法； (4)基於BERT和sigmoid函數的文本分類模型(BERT-Classification)。使用四個指標來比較模型的性能：準確度、召回率、精確度和 F1 分數。結果。 BERT-Classification 模型在四個指標方面均優於基於 Bi-LSTM 和 BERT-UniLM 的模型。結論。 BERT分類模型在中醫同義症狀表達標準化方面具有優越的性能。","","C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\7976LXES\Zhou 等。 - 2021 - Natural Language Processing Algorithms for Normali.pdf","","","","Mediani Ahmed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To explore the novel approaches of research on TCM diagnosis and treatment, this paper presents a strategy for the research of insomnia based on machine learning.MethodsFirst of all, 654 insomnia cases have been collected from an experienced doctor of TCM as sample data. Secondly, in the light of the characteristics of TCM diagnosis and treatment, the contents of research samples have been divided into four parts: the basic information, the four diagnostic methods, the treatment based on syndrome differentiation and the main prescription. And then, these four parts have been analyzed by three analysis methods, including frequency analysis, association rules and hierarchical cluster analysis. Finally, a comprehensive study of the whole four parts has been conducted by random forest.ResultsResearches of the above four parts revealed some essential connections. Simultaneously, based on the algorithm model established by the random forest, the accuracy of predicting the main prescription by the combinations of the four diagnostic methods and the treatment based on syndrome differentiation was 0.85.

Few studies have examined how clinicians’ EHR workflow (e.g., gaze, keyboard activity, and silence) influences the quality of their communication, the patient's involvement in the encounter, and conversational control of the visit. Methods Twenty-three primary care providers (PCPs) from USA Veterans Administration (VA) primary care clinics participated in the study. Up to 6 patients per PCP were recruited. The proportion of time PCPs spent gazing at the computer was captured in real time via video-recording. Mouse click/scrolling activity was captured through Morae, a usability software that logs mouse clicks and scrolling activity. Conversational silence was coded as the proportion of time in the visit when PCP and patient were not talking. After the visit, patients completed patient satisfaction measures. Trained coders independently viewed videos of the interactions and rated the degree to which PCPs were patient-centered (informative, supportive, partnering) and patients were involved in the consultation. Conversational control was measured as the proportion of time the PCP held the floor compared to the patient. Results The final sample included 125 consultations. PCPs who spent more time in the consultation gazing at the computer and whose visits had more conversational silence were rated lower in patient-centeredness. PCPs controlled more of the talk time in the visits that also had longer periods of mutual silence. Conclusions PCPs were rated as having less effective communication when they spent more time looking at the computer and when there was more periods of silence in the consultation. Because PCPs increasingly are using the EHR in their consultations, more research is needed to determine effective ways that they can verbally engage patients while simultaneously managing data in the EHR. Practice implications EHR activity consumes an increasing proportion of clinicians’ time during consultations. To ensure effective communication with their patients, clinicians may benefit from using communication strategies that maintain the flow of conversation when working with the computer, as well as from learning EHR management skills that prevent extended periods of gaze at computer and long periods of silence. Next-generation EHR design must address better usability and clinical workflow integration, including facilitating patient-clinician communication.","2014-09-01","2022-12-15 02:01:15","2024-03-26 15:05:19","2022-12-15 02:52:57","315-319","","3","96","","Patient Education and Counseling","Provider interaction with the electronic health record","Communication in Healthcare: Lessons from Diversity","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","109 citations (Crossref) [2024-03-26] 122 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2023-01-11] abstractTranslation:  目的 帶有電子健康記錄 (EHR) 的計算機是醫療諮詢中的額外“交互者”，因為臨床醫生必須同時或交替使用患者和計算機來提供醫療護理。很少有研究探討臨床醫生的 EHR 工作流程（例如凝視、鍵盤活動和沈默）如何影響他們的溝通質量、患者對就診的參與以及就診的對話控制。方法 來自美國退伍軍人管理局 (VA) 初級保健診所的 23 名初級保健提供者 (PCP) 參與了本研究。每個 PCP 最多招募 6 名患者。通過視頻記錄實時記錄 PCP 凝視電腦的時間比例。鼠標點擊/滾動活動是通過 Morae 捕獲的，Morae 是一款記錄鼠標點擊和滾動活動的可用性軟件。對話沉默被編碼為就診期間 PCP 和患者不說話的時間比例。訪問結束後，患者完成了患者滿意度測量。訓練有素的編碼員獨立觀看互動視頻，並對 PCP 以患者為中心（提供信息、提供支持、合作）以及患者參與諮詢的程度進行評分。對話控制的衡量標準是 PCP 與患者保持發言的時間比例。結果 最終樣本包括 125 次諮詢。在諮詢中花更多時間盯著電腦以及就診時保持更多沉默的 PCP 在以患者為中心的方面評分較低。 PCP 在訪問中控制了更多的談話時間，也有更長的相互沉默時間。結論 當 PCP 花更多時間看電腦以及諮詢過程中出現更多沉默時，他們的溝通效率會降低。由於 PCP 在諮詢中越來越多地使用 EHR，因此需要進行更多研究來確定他們在管理 EHR 數據的同時與患者進行口頭交流的有效方法。實踐影響 EHR 活動在諮詢期間消耗了臨床醫生越來越多的時間。為了確保與患者的有效溝通，臨床醫生可能會受益於在使用計算機時使用保持對話流暢的溝通策略，以及學習電子病歷管理技能，以防止長時間注視計算機和長時間沉默。下一代 EHR 設計必須解決更好的可用性和臨床工作流程集成問題，包括促進患者與臨床醫生的溝通。 titleTranslation: 提供者與電子健康記錄的互動：對醫療遭遇中以患者為中心的溝通的影響","","","","","Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Ambulatory Care Facilities; Communication; Electronic Health Records; Electronic medical records; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Patient centered communication; Patient Participation; Patient Satisfaction; Patient-Centered Care; Physician workflow; Physician-Patient Relations; Practice Patterns, Physicians'; Primary Health Care; Quality of Health Care; Referral and Consultation; United States; United States Department of Veterans Affairs; Videotape Recording","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Compared with Western medicine, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) involves selecting the specific treatment method, prescription, and medication based on the dialectical results of each patient’s symptoms. For this reason, the development of a TCM-assisted decision-making system has lagged. Treatment based on syndrome differentiation is the core of TCM treatment; TCM doctors can dialectically classify diseases according to patients’ symptoms and optimize treatment in time. Therefore, the essence of a TCM-assisted decision-making system is a TCM intelligent, dialectical algorithm. Symptoms stored in electronic medical records are mostly associated with patients’ diseases; however, symptoms of TCM are mostly subjectively identified. In general electronic medical records, there are many missing values. TCM medical records, in which symptoms tend to cause high-dimensional sparse data, reduce algorithm accuracy. Objective This study aims to construct an algorithm model compatible for the multidimensional, highly sparse, and multiclassification task of TCM syndrome differentiation, so that it can be effectively applied to the intelligent dialectic of different diseases. Methods The relevant terms in electronic medical records were standardized with respect to symptoms and evidence-based criteria of TCM. We structuralized case data based on the classification of different symptoms and physical signs according to the 4 diagnostic examinations in TCM diagnosis. A novel cross-feature generation by convolution neural network model performed evidence-based recommendations based on the input embedded, structured medical record data. Results The data set included 5273 real dysmenorrhea cases from the Sichuan TCM big data management platform and the Chinese literature database, which were embedded into 60 fields after being structured and standardized. The training set and test set were randomly constructed in a ratio of 3:1. For the classification of different syndrome types, compared with 6 traditional, intelligent dialectical models and 3 click-through-rate models, the new model showed a good generalization ability and good classification effect. The comprehensive accuracy rate reached 96.21%. Conclusions The main contribution of this study is the construction of a new intelligent dialectical model combining the characteristics of TCM by treating intelligent dialectics as a high-dimensional sparse vector classification task. Owing to the standardization of the input symptoms, all the common symptoms of TCM are covered, and the model can differentiate the symptoms with a variety of missing values. Therefore, with the continuous improvement of disease data sets, this model has the potential to be applied to the dialectical classification of different diseases in TCM.","2022-04-06","2023-04-18 04:40:21","2024-03-26 15:05:18","2023-04-18 04:40:21","e29290","","4","10","","JMIR Med Inform","A Traditional Chinese Medicine Syndrome Classification Model Based on Cross-Feature Generation by Convolution Neural Network","","","","","","","en","","","","","PubMed Central","","8 citations (Crossref) [2024-03-26] 1 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2023-04-18] PMID: 35384854 PMCID: PMC9021949 titleTranslation: 基於卷積神經網絡交叉特徵生成的中醫證候分類模型：模型開發與驗證 abstractTranslation:  背景如今，智能醫療受到廣泛關注，西醫借助人工智能輔助決策也取得了長足進步。與西醫相比，中醫需要根據每個患者的症狀辯證結果來選擇具體的治療方法、方劑和藥物。因此，中醫輔助決策系統的發展相對滯後。辨證論治是中醫治療的核心；中醫可以根據患者的症狀辨證分類，及時優化治療。因此，中醫輔助決策系統的本質是中醫智能辯證算法。電子病歷中存儲的症狀大多與患者的疾病相關；然而，中醫症狀大多是主觀識別的。一般的電子病歷中，存在很多缺失值。中醫病歷中的症狀往往會造成高維稀疏數據，降低了算法的準確性。目的 構建兼容中醫辨證多維、高度稀疏、多分類任務的算法模型，使其能夠有效應用於不同疾病的智能辯證。方法根據症狀和中醫循證標準對電子病歷中的相關術語進行規範。我們根據中醫診斷的四種診斷檢查，根據不同症狀和體徵的分類，對病例數據進行結構化。卷積神經網絡模型的新型交叉特徵生成基於輸入的嵌入式結構化醫療記錄數據執行基於證據的建議。結果數據集包含來自四川省中醫大數據管理平台和中醫文獻數據庫的5273例痛經真實病例，經結構化和標準化後嵌入到60個領域。訓練集和測試集按照3:1的比例隨機構建。對於不同證型的分類，與6種傳統智能辯證模型和3種點擊率模型相比，新模型表現出良好的泛化能力和良好的分類效果。綜合準確率達到96.21%。結論本研究的主要貢獻是將智能辯證視為高維稀疏向量分類任務，構建了結合中醫特點的新型智能辯證模型。由於輸入症狀的標準化，覆蓋了所有中醫常見症狀，模型可以區分各種缺失值的症狀。因此，隨著疾病數據集的不斷完善，該模型有潛力應用於中醫不同疾病的辯證分類。","","C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\NEKTK5DH\Huang 等。 - 2022 - A Traditional Chinese Medicine Syndrome Classifica.pdf; ","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9021949/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using a literature review, the Australian National Guidelines for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), SNOMED-CT-AU and input from health professionals, we developed a Diabetes Mellitus Ontology (DMO) to diagnose and manage patients with diabetes. This paper describes the manual validation of the DMO-based approach using real world EHR data from a general practice (n=908 active patients) participating in the electronic Practice Based Research Network (ePBRN). Method The DMO-based algorithm to query, using Semantic Protocol and RDF Query Language (SPARQL), the structured fields in the ePBRN data repository were iteratively tested and refined. The accuracy of the final DMO-based algorithm was validated with a manual audit of the general practice EHR. Contingency tables were prepared and Sensitivity and Specificity (accuracy) of the algorithm to diagnose T2DM measured, using the T2DM cases found by manual EHR audit as the gold standard. Accuracy was determined with three attributes – reason for visit (RFV), medication (Rx) and pathology (path) – singly and in combination. Results The Sensitivity and Specificity of the algorithm were 100% and 99.88% with RFV; 96.55% and 98.97% with Rx; and 15.6% and 98.92% with Path. This suggests that Rx and Path data were not as complete or correct as the RFV for this general practice, which kept its RFV information complete and current for diabetes. However, the completeness is good enough for this purpose as confirmed by the very small relative deterioration of the accuracy (Sensitivity and Specificity of 97.67% and 99.18%) when calculated for the combination of RFV, Rx and Path. The manual EHR audit suggested that the accuracy of the algorithm was influenced by data quality such as incorrect data due to mistaken units of measurement and unavailable data due to non-documentation or documented in the wrong place or progress notes, problems with data extraction, encryption and data management errors. Conclusion This DMO-based algorithm is sufficiently accurate to support a semantic approach, using the RFV, Rx and Path to define patients with T2DM from EHR data. However, the accuracy can be compromised by incomplete or incorrect data. The extent of compromise requires further study, using ontology-based and other approaches.","2014-10-01","2023-04-19 14:46:35","2024-03-26 15:05:17","2023-04-19 14:46:35","768-778","","10","83","","International Journal of Medical Informatics","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","24 citations (Crossref) [2024-03-26] 51 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2023-04-20] abstractTranslation:  背景 改善慢性病患者的醫療保健需要支持綜合護理和信息交換的臨床信息系統，強調語義方法來支持多個不同的電子健康記錄 (EHR)。通過文獻綜述、澳大利亞國家 2 型糖尿病 (T2DM) 指南、SNOMED-CT-AU 以及衛生專業人員的意見，我們開發了糖尿病本體論 (DMO) 來診斷和管理糖尿病患者。本文描述了使用來自參與電子實踐研究網絡 (ePBRN) 的全科診所（n=908 名活躍患者）的真實 EHR 數據對基於 DMO 的方法進行手動驗證。方法基於DMO的查詢算法，使用語義協議和RDF查詢語言(SPARQL)，對ePBRN數據存儲庫中的結構化字段進行迭代測試和細化。最終基於 DMO 的算法的準確性通過對一般實踐 EHR 的手動審核進行了驗證。使用手動 EHR 審核發現的 T2DM 病例作為黃金標準，準備了列聯表，並測量了診斷 T2DM 算法的敏感性和特異性（準確性）。準確性由三個屬性決定——就診原因 (RFV)、藥物 (Rx) 和病理學 (路徑)——單獨或組合。結果 RFV算法的靈敏度和特異度分別為100%和99.88%； Rx 為 96.55% 和 98.97%；路徑為 15.6% 和 98.92%。這表明 Rx 和 Path 數據不如該全科實踐的 RFV 完整或正確，後者保持了糖尿病 RFV 信息的完整性和最新性。然而，對於此目的來說，完整性已經足夠好了，在計算RFV、Rx 和Path 的組合時，精度相對惡化非常小（靈敏度和特異性分別為97.67% 和99.18%），這證實了這一點。手動EHR 審核表明，算法的準確性受到數據質量的影響，例如由於測量單位錯誤而導致的錯誤數據，以及由於無文檔或記錄在錯誤的位置或進度註釋而導致的數據不可用、數據提取、加密問題和數據管理錯誤。結論 這種基於 DMO 的算法足夠準確，可以支持語義方法，使用 RFV、Rx 和 Path 從 EHR 數據中定義 T2DM 患者。然而，不完整或不正確的數據可能會影響準確性。妥協的程度需要使用基於本體的方法和其他方法進行進一步研究。 titleTranslation: 驗證基於本體的算法以識別電子健康記錄中的 2 型糖尿病患者","","C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\9VXSDD3X\Rahimi 等。 - 2014 - Validating an ontology-based algorithm to identify.pdf; C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\VL5QEEQ3\S1386505614001038.html","","","Electronic Health Records; Diabetes Mellitus; Ontology; SPARQL; Type 2; Validation studies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Especially in ontology engineering, logical inconsistencies may occur during ontology construction. A natural way to reason with an inconsistent ontology is to utilize the maximal consistent subsets of the ontology. However, previous studies on selecting maximum consistent subsets have rarely considered the semantics of the axioms, which may result in irrational inference. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to reasoning with inconsistent ontologies in description logics based on the embeddings of axioms. We first give a method for turning axioms into distributed semantic vectors to compute the semantic connections between the axioms. We then define an embedding-based method for selecting the maximum consistent subsets and use it to define an inconsistency-tolerant inference relation. We show the rationality of our inference relation by considering some logical properties. Finally, we conduct experiments on several ontologies to evaluate the reasoning power of our inference relation.

This comes at a significant computational cost. On the other hand,sequence labeling approaches for OpenIE are much faster, but worse in extraction quality. In this paper, we bridge this trade-off by presenting an iterative labeling-based system that establishes a new state of the art for OpenIE, while extracting 10x faster. This is achieved through a novel Iterative Grid Labeling (IGL) architecture, which treats OpenIE as a 2-D grid labeling task. We improve its performance further by applying coverage (soft) constraints on the grid at training time.

Similar problem exists in temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs), and no previous temporal knowledge graph completion (TKGC) method is developed for modeling newly-emerged entities.

We propose a few-shot out-of-graph (OOG) link prediction task for TKGs, where we predict the missing entities from the links concerning unseen entities by employing a meta-learning framework and utilizing the meta-information provided by only few edges associated with each unseen entity.

Specifically, we discuss a notion of explanation termed ontological unpacking, which aims at explaining symbolic domain descriptions (conceptual models, knowledge graphs, logical specifications) by revealing their ontological commitment in terms of their assumed truthmakers, i.e., the entities in one's ontology that make the propositions in those descriptions true. To illustrate this idea, we employ an ontological theory of relations to explain (by revealing the hidden semantics of) a very simple symbolic model encoded in the standard modeling language UML. We also discuss the essential role played by ontology-driven conceptual models (resulting from this form of explanation processes) in properly supporting semantic interoperability tasks.

Our discussion is based on the concept of propositional sentences consisting of \textit{subject-predicate-object} (SPO) triples for expressing elementary facts. SPO sentences are the basis for most natural languages but might also be important for explicit perception and declarative memories, as well as intra-brain communication and the ability to argue and reason. A set of SPO sentences can be described as a knowledge graph, which can be transformed into an adjacency tensor. We introduce tensor models, where concepts have dual representations as indices and associated embeddings, two constructs we believe are essential for the understanding of implicit and explicit perception and memory in the brain. We argue that a biological realization of perception and memory imposes constraints on information processing. In particular, we propose that explicit perception and declarative memories require a semantic decoder, which, in a simple realization, is based on four layers: First, a sensory memory layer, as a buffer for sensory input, second, an index layer representing concepts, third, a memoryless representation layer for the broadcasting of information ---the ""blackboard"", or the ""canvas"" of the brain--- and fourth, a working memory layer as a processing center and data buffer. We discuss the operations of the four layers and relate them to the global workspace theory. In a Bayesian brain interpretation, semantic memory defines the prior for observable triple statements. We propose that ---in evolution and during development--- semantic memory, episodic memory, and natural language evolved as emergent properties in agents' process to gain a deeper understanding of sensory information.","2020-02-10","2023-07-18 07:55:31","2023-11-23 09:23:47","2023-07-18 07:55:31","","","","","","","The Tensor Brain","","","","","","","en","","","","","arXiv.org","","7 citations (Semantic Scholar/arXiv) [2023-07-20] arXiv:2001.11027 [cs, stat] titleTranslation: 張量大腦：感知和記憶的語義解碼 abstractTranslation:  我們使用知識圖和張量的數學模型來分析感知和記憶，以深入了解人類思維的相應功能。我們的討論基於由 \textit{主謂賓} (SPO) 三元組組成的命題句子的概念，用於表達基本事實。 SPO 句子是大多數自然語言的基礎，但對於外顯感知和陳述性記憶、腦內交流以及爭論和推理的能力也可能很重要。一組SPO句子可以描述為知識圖，可以將其轉化為鄰接張量。我們引入張量模型，其中概念具有作為索引和相關嵌入的雙重表示，我們認為這兩種結構對於理解大腦中的內隱和外顯感知和記憶至關重要。我們認為感知和記憶的生物學實現對信息處理施加了限制。特別是，我們提出顯性感知和陳述性記憶需要一個語義解碼器，在簡單的實現中，它基於四個層：第一，感覺記憶層，作為感覺輸入的緩衝區，第二，表示概念的索引層第三，用於信息廣播的無記憶表示層——大腦的“黑板”或“畫布”；第四，作為處理中心和數據緩衝區的工作記憶層。我們討論四層的操作並將它們與全局工作空間理論聯繫起來。在貝葉斯大腦解釋中，語義記憶定義了可觀察的三重陳述的先驗。我們提出，在進化和發展過程中，語義記憶、情景記憶和自然語言作為智能體過程中的新興屬性而進化，以獲得對感官信息的更深入理解。","","C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\9SYST5WR\Tresp et al. - 2020 - The Tensor Brain Semantic Decoding for Perception and Memory.pdf","","未整理; 待讀","Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science - Machine Learning; Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition; Statistics - Machine Learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2001.11027","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, LLMs are black-box models, which often fall short of capturing and accessing factual knowledge. In contrast, Knowledge Graphs (KGs), Wikipedia and Huapu for example, are structured knowledge models that explicitly store rich factual knowledge. KGs can enhance LLMs by providing external knowledge for inference and interpretability. Meanwhile, KGs are difficult to construct and evolving by nature, which challenges the existing methods in KGs to generate new facts and represent unseen knowledge. Therefore, it is complementary to unify LLMs and KGs together and simultaneously leverage their advantages. In this article, we present a forward-looking roadmap for the unification of LLMs and KGs. Our roadmap consists of three general frameworks, namely, 1) KG-enhanced LLMs, which incorporate KGs during the pre-training and inference phases of LLMs, or for the purpose of enhancing understanding of the knowledge learned by LLMs; 2) LLM-augmented KGs, that leverage LLMs for different KG tasks such as embedding, completion, construction, graph-to-text generation, and question answering; and 3) Synergized LLMs + KGs, in which LLMs and KGs play equal roles and work in a mutually beneficial way to enhance both LLMs and KGs for bidirectional reasoning driven by both data and knowledge. We review and summarize existing efforts within these three frameworks in our roadmap and pinpoint their future research directions.","2023-06-20","2023-07-27 06:01:53","2023-11-23 09:23:45","2023-07-27 06:01:53","","","","","","","Unifying Large Language Models and Knowledge Graphs","","","","","arXiv","","en","","","","","arXiv.org","","2 citations (Semantic Scholar/arXiv) [2023-07-27] 2 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2023-07-27] arXiv:2306.08302 [cs] titleTranslation: 統一大型語言模型和知識圖：路線圖 abstractTranslation:  ChatGPT 和 GPT4 等大型語言模型 (LLM) 憑藉其新興能力和泛化性，正在自然語言處理和人工智能領域掀起新的浪潮。然而，法學碩士是黑盒模型，通常無法捕獲和獲取事實知識。相比之下，知識圖譜（KG）、維基百科和花譜等都是結構化知識模型，顯式存儲豐富的事實知識。知識圖譜可以通過提供用於推理和可解釋性的外部知識來增強法學碩士。同時，知識圖譜本質上難以構建和進化，這對知識圖譜中現有的生成新事實和表示未見知識的方法提出了挑戰。因此，將LLM和KG結合起來，同時發揮各自的優勢，是互補的。在本文中，我們提出了 LLM 和 KG 統一的前瞻性路線圖。我們的路線圖由三個總體框架組成，即1）知識圖譜增強型法學碩士，在法學碩士的預訓練和推理階段納入知識圖譜，或者為了增強對法學碩士所學知識的理解； 2）LLM增強知識圖譜，利用LLM來完成不同的知識圖譜任務，例如嵌入、完成、構造、圖文生成和問答； 3）協同LLM+KG，其中LLM和KG發揮平等作用，以互惠互利的方式工作，以增強LLM和KG的數據和知識驅動的雙向推理能力。我們在路線圖中回顧和總結了這三個框架內的現有工作，並確定了它們未來的研究方向。","","C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\NAKQZZVQ\Pan 等。 - 2023 - Unifying Large Language Models and Knowledge Graph.pdf; C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\C3B4SJZ8\2306.html","","重要; 未整理; 待讀","Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science - Computation and Language","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2306.08302","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

ABox reasoning is a process of discovering implicit knowledge in ABox based on the existing KB, which is of great value in KB applications. ABox reasoning is influenced by both the complexity of TBox and scale of ABox. The traditional logic-based ontology reasoning methods are usually designed to be provably sound and complete but suffer from long algorithm runtimes and do not scale well for ontology KB represented by OWL DL (Description Logic). In some application scenarios, the soundness and completeness of reasoning results are not the key constraints, and it is acceptable to sacrifice them in exchange for the improvement of reasoning efficiency to some extent. Based on this view, an approximate reasoning method for large-scale ABox in OWL DL KBs was proposed, which is named the ChunfyReasoner (CFR). The CFR introduces neural-symbolic learning into ABox reasoning and integrates the advantages of symbolic systems and neural networks (NNs). By training the NN model, the CFR approximately compiles the logic deduction process of ontology reasoning, which can greatly improve the reasoning speed while ensuring higher reasoning quality. In this paper, we state the basic idea, framework, and construction process of the CFR in detail, and we conduct experiments on two open-source ontologies built on OWL DL. The experimental results verify the effectiveness of our method and show that the CFR can support the applications of large-scale ABox reasoning of OWL DL KBs.","2023-01","2023-07-28 05:59:05","2024-03-26 15:04:53","2023-07-28 05:59:05","495","","3","11","","","","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","www.mdpi.com","","0 citations (Crossref) [2024-03-26] 0 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2023-08-11] Number: 3 Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute titleTranslation: 基於神經符號學習的OWL DL大規模ABox近似推理 abstractTranslation:  本體知識庫（KB）可以分為兩部分：TBox和ABox，前者對領域內的模式級知識進行建模，後者是一組關於實例的斷言或事實的陳述。 ABox推理是基於現有知識庫發現ABox中隱含知識的過程，這在知識庫應用中具有重要價值。 ABox 推理受到 TBox 複雜度和 ABox 規模的影響。傳統的基於邏輯的本體推理方法通常被設計為可證明合理且完整，但算法運行時間長，並且對於以 OWL DL（描述邏輯）為代表的本體 KB 來說擴展性不佳。在某些應用場景中，推理結果的健全性和完整性並不是關鍵約束，犧牲它們來換取一定程度推理效率的提升也是可以接受的。基於這一觀點，提出了一種OWL DL KB中大規模ABox的近似推理方法，稱為ChunfyReasoner（CFR）。 CFR 將神經符號學習引入 ABox 推理中，並融合了符號系統和神經網絡（NN）的優點。 CFR通過訓練NN模型，近似編譯本體推理的邏輯推導過程，在保證較高推理質量的同時，可以大大提高推理速度。在本文中，我們詳細闡述了CFR的基本思想、框架和構建過程，並在兩個基於OWL DL的開源本體上進行了實驗。實驗結果驗證了我們方法的有效性，並表明CFR可以支持OWL DL KB的大規模ABox推理的應用。","","C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\NTTNXXCD\Zhu 等。 - 2023 - Approximate Reasoning for Large-Scale ABox in OWL .pdf","","知識挖掘; 機器學習; 知識本體; 待讀; 知識推理; CNN; 數學; 理論基礎","approximate reasoning; large-scale ABox reasoning; neural-symbolic learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: We applied the entity-linking framework to normalize Chinese diagnosis and procedure terms, which consists of two steps - candidate concept generation and candidate concept ranking. For candidate concept generation, we implemented both the traditional BM25 algorithm and an extended version that integrates a synonym knowledgebase. For candidate concept ranking, we investigated a number of different algorithms: (1) the BM25 algorithm, (2) ranking support vector machines (RankSVM), (3) a previously reported Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) approach, (4) 11 deep ranking-based methods from the MatchZoo toolkit, and (5) a new BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) based ranking method. Using two manually annotated datasets (8,547 diagnoses and 8,282 procedures) collected from a Tier 3A hospital in China, we evaluated above methods and reported their performance (i.e., accuracy) at different cutoffs. RESULTS: The coverage of candidate concept generation was greatly improved after integrating the synonym knowledgebase, achieving 97.9% for diagnoses and 93.4% for procedures respectively. Overall the new BERT-based ranking method achieved the best performance on both diagnosis and procedure normalization, with the best accuracy of 92.1% for diagnosis and 80.1% for procedure, when the top one concept and exact match criteria were used. CONCLUSIONS: This study developed and compared diverse entity-linking methods to normalize clinical terms in Chinese and our evaluation shows good performance on mapping disease terms to ICD codes, demonstrating the feasibility of automated encoding of clinical terms in Chinese.","2020-05","2023-07-28 06:47:08","2024-04-26 09:01:36","","103418","","","105","","J Biomed Inform","","","","","","","","en","","","","","PubMed","","16 citations (Crossref) [2024-03-26] 22 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2023-08-11] PMID: 32298846 titleTranslation: 將中文診斷和程序術語規範化為 ICD 代碼的實體鏈接方法研究 abstractTranslation:  目的：本研究旨在開發和評估有效的方法，使醫生編寫的診斷和程序術語標準化為中文國際疾病分類（ICD）中的標準概念，以促進中國的自動化醫療編碼。方法：我們應用實體鏈接框架來標準化中文診斷和程序術語，該框架包括兩個步驟：候選概念生成和候選概念排序。對於候選概念生成，我們實現了傳統的 BM25 算法和集成同義詞知識庫的擴展版本。對於候選概念排名，我們研究了許多不同的算法：(1) BM25 算法，(2) 排名支持向量機 (RankSVM)，(3) 先前報導的捲積神經網絡 (CNN) 方法，(4) 11 深度MatchZoo 工具包中基於排名的方法，以及(5) 一種新的基於BERT（來自Transformers 的雙向編碼器表示）的排名方法。使用從中國三級醫院收集的兩個手動註釋的數據集（8,547 例診斷和 8,282 例手術），我們評估了上述方法並報告了它們在不同截止值下的性能（即準確性）。結果：整合同義詞知識庫後，候選概念生成的覆蓋率大大提高，診斷覆蓋率達到97.9%，手術覆蓋率達到93.4%。總體而言，當使用頂級概念和精確匹配標準時，基於BERT 的新排序方法在診斷和程序標準化方面均取得了最佳性能，診斷的最佳準確率為92.1%，程序的最佳準確率為80.1 %。結論：本研究開發並比較了多種實體鏈接方法來規範中文臨床術語，我們的評估顯示在將疾病術語映射到 ICD 代碼方面具有良好的性能，證明了中文臨床術語自動編碼的可行性。","","; C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\Z9I6S76U\Wang 等。 - 2020 - A study of entity-linking methods for normalizing .pdf","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32298846","BERT; 機器學習; 已整理; 醫療; 中文; ICD; 實體連結","China; Clinical Coding; Computer assisted coding; Entity-linking; ICD encoding; International Classification of Diseases; Neural Networks, Computer; Support Vector Machine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Many previous works apply supervised methods which require a lot of annotated data. However, they can not address the challenge brought by the high cost of medical data annotation, which requires sufficient professional knowledge and experience. Meanwhile, existing unsupervised methods perform poorly facing the various non-standard expression from different data sources. In this paper, we propose DUNE, Disease Unsupervised Normalization by Embedding, an unsupervised Chinese medical concept normalization framework by applying denoising auto-encoder (DAE) and network embedding. We formulate this task as finding mention-entity pairs with great text and comorbidity similarity. To handle the noise in text, we design a multi-view attention based denoising auto-encoder (MADAE) to capture text information from multiple views, reduce the influence of noise, and transform text to denoised vectors. To introduce comorbidity information, we construct a comorbidity network with both standard and non-standard disease names as nodes from medical records. Because of the diversity of nonstandard expressions, one disease perhaps corresponds to several different nodes, which causes noise in comorbidity network. To handle such network structure noise, we propose a denoising network embedding framework, which reduce the structure noise with the help of text information, to embed the nodes to vectors for comorbidity similarity measurement. Convincing experiment results show that our method performs better than existing unsupervised baselines and approaches the performance of classical supervised machine learning model on this task.","2018-01","2023-07-28 06:51:18","2024-03-26 15:04:51","","777-786","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","6 citations (Crossref) [2024-03-26] 6 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2023-08-11] ISSN: 2374-8486 titleTranslation: 使用文本和合併症網絡嵌入進行中醫概念規範化 abstractTranslation:  中醫概念規範化是將非標準醫學概念映射為標準表達的自然語言處理任務，在醫學大數據研究和臨床統計中有著廣泛的應用。以前的許多工作都應用了需要大量註釋數據的監督方法。然而，它們無法解決醫療數據標註成本高昂帶來的挑戰，這需要足夠的專業知識和經驗。同時，現有的無監督方法在面對來自不同數據源的各種非標準表達時表現不佳。在本文中，我們提出了 DUNE（Disease Unsupervised Normalization by Embedding），這是一種應用去噪自動編碼器（DAE）和網絡嵌入的無監督中醫概念標準化框架。我們將這個任務表述為尋找具有良好文本和共病相似性的提及實體對。為了處理文本中的噪聲，我們設計了一種基於多視圖注意的去噪自動編碼器（MADAE）來從多個視圖捕獲文本信息，減少噪聲的影響，並將文本轉換為去噪向量。為了引入合併症信息，我們構建了一個合併症網絡，其中標準和非標準疾病名稱作為醫療記錄中的節點。由於非標準表達的多樣性，一種疾病可能對應多個不同的節點，這會導致共病網絡中出現噪聲。為了處理這種網絡結構噪聲，我們提出了一種去噪網絡嵌入框架，它藉助文本信息來減少結構噪聲，將節點嵌入到向量中以進行共病相似性測量。令人信服的實驗結果表明，我們的方法比現有的無監督基線表現更好，並且接近經典監督機器學習模型在此任務上的性能。","","C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\RNMR9DBB\8594902.html; C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\662NTKUS\Zhang 等。 - 2018 - Chinese Medical Concept Normalization by Using Tex.pdf","","","Diseases; medical concept normalization, comorbidity network embedding, denoising auto-encoder; Medical diagnostic imaging; Noise reduction; Standards; Task analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2018 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, symbolic reasoning is intolerant of the ambiguous and noisy data. On the contrary, the recent advances of deep learning have promoted neural reasoning on knowledge graphs, which is robust to the ambiguous and noisy data, but lacks interpretability compared to symbolic reasoning. Considering the advantages and disadvantages of both methodologies, recent efforts have been made on combining the two reasoning methods.

Deep Learning processes build the prediction model purely based on fitting weights on the raw data inside multiple neural layers, which is difficult to explain the prediction outputs. However, telling ‘WHY’ is crucial for healthcare research. The major difficulty to explain in Deep Learning models is a lack of knowledge-based analysis environment that not only can model the knowledge in a machine-understandable way but also can create causal probability relations inside the knowledge. In our research, we propose a Causal Probability Description Logic (CPDL) framework that extended the current Description Logic (DL). The key extension is to have a two-layer DL representation. One layer represents causality knowledge. The other layer takes observation inputs e.g. symptoms for generating a runtime probability knowledge graph based on the previous layer's knowledge. The CPDL framework can support probability-based causal reasoning tasks in a transparent and human-understandable way.

We introduce a degree-of-knowledge model that computes automatically, for each source-code element in a codebase, a real value that represents a developer's knowledge of that element based on a developer's authorship and interaction data. We present evidence that shows that both authorship and interaction data of the code are important in characterizing a developer's knowledge of code.

However, as the Web and its latently embedded facts evolve, a knowledge base can never be complete and up-to-date. On the other hand, a rapidly increasing suite of Web services provide access to timely and high-quality information, but this is encapsulated by the service interface. We propose to leverage the information that could be dynamically obtained from Web services in order to enrich RDF knowledge bases on the fly whenever the knowledge base does not suffice to answer a user query. To this end, we develop a sound framework for appropriately generating queries to encapsulated Web services and efficient algorithms for query execution and result integration. The query generator composes sequences of function calls based on the available service interfaces. As Web service calls are expensive, our method aims to reduce the number of calls in order to retrieve results with sufficient recall. Our approach is fully implemented in a complete prototype system named ANGIE1. The user can query and browse the RDF knowledge base as if it already contained all the facts from the Web services. This data, however, is gathered and integrated on the fly, transparently to the user.

Our study leads to a new framework, Symbolic Knowledge Distillation. As with prior art in Knowledge Distillation (Hinton et al., 2015), our approach uses larger models to teach smaller models. A key difference is that we distill knowledge symbolically-as text-in addition to the neural model. We also distill only one aspect-the commonsense of a general language model teacher, allowing the student to be a different type, a commonsense model. Altogether, we show that careful prompt engineering and a separately trained critic model allow us to selectively distill high-quality causal commonsense from GPT-3, a general language model. Empirical results demonstrate that, for the first time, a human-authored commonsense knowledge graph is surpassed by our automatically distilled variant in all three criteria: quantity, quality, and diversity. In addition, it results in a neural commonsense model that surpasses the teacher model's commonsense capabilities despite its 100x smaller size.

Explanations are typically developed by AI experts and focus on algorithmic transparency and the inner workings of AI systems. Research has shown that such explanations do not meet the needs of users who do not have AI expertise. As a result, explanations are often ineffective in making system decisions interpretable and understandable. We aim to strengthen a socio-technical view of AI by following a Human-Centered Explainable Artificial Intelligence (HC-XAI) approach, which investigates the explanation needs of end-users (i.e., subject matter experts and lay users) in specific usage contexts. One of the most influential works in this area is the XAI Question Bank (XAIQB) by Liao et al. The authors propose a set of questions that end-users might ask when using an AI system, which in turn is intended to help developers and designers identify and address explanation needs. Although the XAIQB is widely referenced, there are few reports of its use in practice. In particular, it is unclear to what extent the XAIQB sufficiently captures the explanation needs of end-users and what potential problems exist in the practical application of the XAIQB. To explore these open questions, we used the XAIQB as the basis for analyzing 12 think-aloud software explorations with subject matter experts, i.e., art historians. We investigated the suitability of the XAIQB as a tool for identifying explanation needs in a specific usage context. Our analysis revealed a number of explanation needs that were missing from the question bank, but that emerged repeatedly as our study participants interacted with an AI system. We also found that some of the XAIQB questions were difficult to distinguish and required interpretation during use. Our contribution is an extension of the XAIQB with 11 new questions. In addition, we have expanded the descriptions of all new and existing questions to facilitate their use. We hope that this extension will enable HCI researchers and practitioners to use the XAIQB in practice and may provide a basis for future studies on the identification of explanation needs in different contexts.","2023-09-03","2023-08-24 05:26:48","2024-03-26 15:04:39","2023-08-23","492–497","","","","","","Identifying Explanation Needs of End-users","MuC '23","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","en","","","","","ACM Digital Library","","0 citations (Crossref) [2024-03-26] titleTranslation: 確定最終用戶的解釋需求：應用和擴展 XAI 問題庫 abstractTranslation:  可解釋的人工智能（XAI）致力於使人工智能係統的決策能夠被人類解釋。解釋通常由人工智能專家製定，重點關注算法透明度和人工智能係統的內部運作。研究表明，這樣的解釋不能滿足不具備人工智能專業知識的用戶的需求。因此，解釋通常無法有效地使系統決策變得可解釋和理解。我們的目標是通過遵循以人為中心的可解釋人工智能（HC-XAI）方法來加強人工智能的社會技術觀點，該方法研究最終用戶（即主題專家和非專業用戶）在特定使用環境中的解釋需求。該領域最有影響力的作品之一是 Liao 等人的 XAI 題庫（XAIQB）。作者提出了最終用戶在使用人工智能係統時可能會問的一系列問題，旨在幫助開發人員和設計人員識別和解決解釋需求。儘管 XAIQB 被廣泛引用，但其實際使用的報導卻很少。特別是，目前尚不清楚XAIQB在多大程度上充分捕獲了最終用戶的解釋需求以及XAIQB在實際應用中存在哪些潛在問題。為了探索這些懸而未決的問題，我們使用 XAIQB 作為與主題專家（即藝術史學家）一起分析 12 個有聲思考軟件探索的基礎。我們研究了 XAIQB 作為識別特定使用上下文中的解釋需求的工具的適用性。我們的分析揭示了問題庫中缺失的許多解釋需求，但當我們的研究參與者與人工智能係統交互時，這些需求反復出現。我們還發現，XAIQB 的一些問題在使用過程中很難區分，需要解釋。我們的貢獻是 XAIQB 的擴展，增加了 11 個新問題。此外，我們還擴展了所有新問題和現有問題的描述，以方便其使用。我們希望這一擴展將使人機交互研究人員和從業者能夠在實踐中使用 XAIQB，並為未來在不同背景下識別解釋需求的研究提供基礎。","","C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\G9SKW2MR\Sipos 等。 - 2023 - Identifying Explanation Needs of End-users Applyi.pdf","","機器學習; 回收; 使用者研究; 可解釋性","Explainable AI; Explanation needs; Human-AI collaboration; User study","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This involves abstract concepts of students' states of knowledge and the interactions between those states and skills. Therefore, a KT model is designed to predict whether students will give correct answers and to describe such abstract concepts. However, existing methods either give relatively low prediction accuracy or fail to explain those concepts intuitively. In this paper, we propose a new model called Knowledge Query Network (KQN) to solve these problems. KQN uses neural networks to encode student learning activities into knowledge state and skill vectors, and models the interactions between the two types of vectors with the dot product. Through this, we introduce a novel concept called probabilistic skill similarity that relates the pairwise cosine and Euclidean distances between skill vectors to the odds ratios of the corresponding skills, which makes KQN interpretable and intuitive. On four public datasets, we have carried out experiments to show the following: 1. KQN outperforms all the existing KT models based on prediction accuracy. 2. The interaction between the knowledge state and skills can be visualized for interpretation. 3. Based on probabilistic skill similarity, a skill domain can be analyzed with clustering using the distances between the skill vectors of KQN. 4. For different values of the vector space dimensionality, KQN consistently exhibits high prediction accuracy and a strong positive correlation between the distance matrices of the skill vectors.","2019-03-04","2023-08-24 05:21:19","2024-03-26 15:04:43","2023-08-23","491–500","","","","","","Knowledge Query Network for Knowledge Tracing","LAK19","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","en","","","","","ACM Digital Library","","26 citations (Crossref) [2024-03-26] titleTranslation: 用於知識追踪的知識查詢網絡：知識如何與技能交互 abstractTranslation:  知識追踪（KT）是在學生解決由其相關技能代表的一系列問題時追踪學生的知識。這涉及學生知識狀態的抽象概念以及這些狀態和技能之間的交互。因此，KT模型旨在預測學生是否會給出正確的答案並描述此類抽象概念。然而，現有的方法或相對較低的預測精度，或無法解釋這些概念。在本文中，我們提出了一種稱為知識查詢網絡(KQN )的新模型來解決這些問題。KQN利用神經網絡將學生的學習活動編碼為知識狀態和技能提供，並用點積對兩類提供之間的應答進行建模。通過這件事，在在四個公共數據集上，我們進行了實驗，結果表明： 1.

However, traditional Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) are directly pre-trained on large-scale natural language corpus, which poses challenges for them in understanding and representing complex subgraphs in structured KBs. To bridge the gap between texts and structured KBs, we propose a Structured Knowledge-aware Pre-training method (SKP).

However, previous works did not answer how or even whether community managers can improve the efficiency of tags. In this work, we use information-theoretic measures to track the descriptive and retrieval efficiency of tags on Stack Overflow, a question-answering system that strictly limits the number of tags users can specify per question. We observe that tagging efficiency stabilizes over time, while tag content and descriptiveness both increase. To explain this observation, we hypothesize that limiting the number of tags fosters novelty and diversity in tag usage, two properties which are both beneficial for tagging efficiency.

Especially since the COVID-19 pandemic, VUI has gained more attention in online communication owing to its non-contact property. However, VUI struggles to be applied in public scenes due to the degradation of received audio signals caused by various ambient noises. In this paper, we propose Wavoice, the first noise-resistant multi-modal speech recognition system that fuses two distinct voice sensing modalities, i.e., millimeter-wave (mmWave) signals and audio signals from a microphone, together. One key contribution is to model the inherent correlation between mmWave and audio signals. Based on it, Wavoice facilitates the real-time noise-resistant voice activity detection and user targeting from multiple speakers. Additionally, we elaborate on two novel modules for multi-modal fusion embedded into the neural network, leading to accurate speech recognition. Extensive experiments prove the effectiveness of Wavoice under adverse conditions, that is, the character recognition error rate below 1%%\% in a range of 7 meters. In terms of robustness and accuracy, Wavoice considerably outperforms existing audio-only speech recognition methods with lower character error rate and word error rate.","2023-05-18","2023-09-04 01:54:58","2024-03-26 15:04:26","2023-09-04 01:54:58","","","","","","ACM Trans.

We build on this research by testing whether coherence emerges in tag usage on Q&As, a more challenging context, focusing in particular on mismatches in the specificity of tags (basic level disagreement).

However, current models for opinion tagging are not personalized, even though personalization is an essential ingredient of engaging user interactions, especially in e-commerce.

There are two main challenges when developing models for the end-to-end generation of personalized opinion tags: sparseness of reviews and difficulty to integrate multi-type signals, i.e., explicit review signals and implicit behavioral signals. To address these challenges, we propose an end-to-end model, named POT, that consists of three main components: (1) a review-based explicit preference tracker component based on a hierarchical heterogeneous review graph to track user preferences from reviews; (2)a behavior-based implicit preference tracker component using a heterogeneous behavior graph to track the user preferences from implicit behaviors; and (3) a personalized rank-aware tagging component to generate a ranked sequence of personalized opinion tags.

Generally, individuals have no perception of the air quality around them and in the city where they live, and their knowledge of the subject depends on what they learn from newscasts or newspapers. However, increasing awareness of the topic can help them make more conscious choices.

With the aim of investigating the best communication modality that, eventually, can raise awareness on the topic, we performed a preliminary study. To anticipate some findings, we found out that the videos were considered less mentally demanding and less frustrating, while the sound was considered more pleasant. At the same time, while the videos required less time to be understood and communicated a more precise level of pollution, the audios were considered, on hand, more involving, making the users also feel more immersed in the experience, and, on the other hand, gave the possibility to concentrate on something else while experiencing the data.","2023-09-06","2023-09-06 09:35:16","2024-03-26 15:04:20","2023-09-06","510–516","","","","","","What Does Air Quality Sound Like?","GoodIT '23","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","en","","","","","ACM Digital Library","","0 citations (Crossref) [2024-03-26] titleTranslation: 空氣質量聽起來怎麼樣？探索數據可聽化與數據可視化的影響 abstractTranslation:  空氣污染是當前的熱門話題和重大威脅，不僅影響氣候變化，還影響個人健康。事實上，據估計，每年有 670 萬人過早死亡，而且到 2021 年，97% 的城市人口所接觸的顆粒物濃度超過了世界衛生組織的健康指南。一般來說，個人對其周圍和所居住城市的空氣質量沒有任何感知，他們對該主題的了解取決於他們從新聞廣播或報紙中了解到的信息。然而，提高對該主題的認識可以幫助他們做出更有意識的選擇。為了部分解決這個問題，我們開發了一個基於網絡的原型，利用兩種方式來傳達空氣質量數據：數據聲音化（通過音頻）和數據可視化（通過動畫視頻）。為了調查最終可以提高人們對該主題的認識的最佳溝通方式，我們進行了初步研究。為了預測一些發現，我們發現這些視頻被認為對精神要求較低，也不那麼令人沮喪，而聲音被認為更令人愉悅。與此同時，雖然視頻需要更少的時間來理解並傳達更精確的污染水平，但音頻被認為一方面更具參與性，使用戶也感覺更沉浸在體驗中，另一方面一方面，讓我們可以在體驗數據的同時專注於其他事情。","","C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\C8YKYA2U\Ceccarini 等。 - 2023 - What Does Air Quality Sound Like On Exploring the.pdf","","人機互動; 回收; 可視化","data visualization; air quality; data sonification","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In addition, researchers have also been exploring new ways of handling sophisticated construction tasks in diversified scenarios. Thus, there is a demand for a systematic review of paradigms to organize knowledge structures beyond data-level mentions. To meet this demand, we comprehensively survey more than 300 methods to summarize the latest developments in knowledge graph construction. A knowledge graph is built in three steps: knowledge acquisition, knowledge refinement, and knowledge evolution. The processes of knowledge acquisition are reviewed in detail, including obtaining entities with fine-grained types and their conceptual linkages to knowledge graphs; resolving coreferences; and extracting entity relationships in complex scenarios. The survey covers models for knowledge refinement, including knowledge graph completion, and knowledge fusion. Methods to handle knowledge evolution are also systematically presented, including condition knowledge acquisition, condition knowledge graph completion, and knowledge dynamic. We present the paradigms to compare the distinction among these methods along the axis of the data environment, motivation, and architecture.

However, compared to ad-hoc retrieval tasks, legal case retrieval has its unique challenges. First, case documents are rather lengthy and contain complex legal structures. Therefore, it is difficult for most existing dense retrieval models to encode an entire document and capture its inherent complex structure information. Most existing methods simply truncate part of the document content to meet the input length limit of PLMs, which will lead to information loss. Additionally, the definition of relevance in the legal domain differs from that in the general domain. Previous semantic-based or lexical-based methods fail to provide a comprehensive understanding of the relevance of legal cases. In this paper, we propose a Structured Legal case Retrieval (SLR) framework, which incorporates internal and external structural information to address the above two challenges. Specifically, to avoid the truncation of long legal documents, the internal structural information, which is the organization pattern of legal documents, can be utilized to split a case document into segments. By dividing the document-level semantic matching task into segment-level subtasks, SLR can separately process segments using different methods based on the characteristic of each segment. In this way, the key elements of a case document can be highlighted without losing other content information. Secondly, towards a better understanding of relevance in the legal domain, we investigate the connections between criminal charges appearing in large-scale case corpus to generate a charge-wise relation graph. Then, the similarity between criminal charges can be pre-computed as the external structural information to enhance the recognition of relevant cases. Finally, a learning-to-rank algorithm integrates the features collected from internal and external structures to output the final retrieval results. Experimental results on public legal case retrieval benchmarks demonstrate the superior effectiveness of SLR over existing state-of-the-art baselines, including traditional bag-of-words and neural-based methods.

It is regarded as crucial for the development of advanced text generation technologies that better meet the specific constraints in practical applications. In recent years, methods using large-scale pre-trained language models (PLMs), in particular the widely used transformer-based PLMs, have become a new paradigm of NLG, allowing generation of more diverse and fluent text. However, due to the limited level of interpretability of deep neural networks, the controllability of these methods need to be guaranteed. To this end, controllable text generation using transformer-based PLMs has become a rapidly growing yet challenging new research hotspot. A diverse range of approaches have emerged in the recent 3-4 years, targeting different CTG tasks that require different types of controlled constraints. In this paper, we present a systematic critical review on the common tasks, main approaches, and evaluation methods in this area. Finally, we discuss the challenges that the field is facing, and put forward various promising future directions.

Recently, deep learning has been applied to sound source localization and provided the substantial improvement in robustness for DOA estimation. In this paper, we propose a sound source localization approach using the deep learning-based steering vector phase difference enhancement. The steering vectors and their estimation reliability functions (ERFs) are first estimated under the guidance of the time-frequency masks that are predicted using deep neural network (DNN). The phase difference of the steering vectors is further enhanced with a second DNN model, which is trained with the ERF-weighted mean square error (MSE) loss. The DOA of the sound source is finally determined by the ERF-weighted histogram analysis.

Another part, however, occurs in ad-hoc encounters such as coffee breaks, or when we meet colleagues or supervisors in corridors or at the canteen. Some have the habit of recording the information and decisions from formal encounters by taking notes on paper or capturing audio or video. However, this is not always possible in ad-hoc meetings, either because of lack of means to carry out the notes or because participants do not realize the need to record what was discussed, thus many information and decisions taken in ad-hoc meetings are lost. In this paper we present a case study that investigates how common is the occurrence of ad-hoc meetings in university campi, and proposes the ""Context-Based Opportunistic Capture"", a Capture & Access technique that uses mobile devices to detect possible occurrences of meetings from user's close proximity and alerts them that a meeting may be held, and suggests that they use their devices to record the meeting in audio or video. As proof of concept we developed an Android application and a context server that were evaluated by means of a case study.

For any organizational context there is something existent with applied classification logic which has to be considered while creating new knowledge. In order to study an impact of stabilizing and dynamic forces on knowledge organization systems we investigate concept compounding as ontological change. As new concepts emerge through knowledge maturing process and have direct impact on enterprise knowledge organization systems, a longitudinal approach is needed that follows development of new concepts over time. We took this approach by analyzing ontology maturing in an international company which provides professional services to both institutional and private customers. We present examples of the compounding of six new concepts as interactions between dynamic forces which are functioning within social technologies and stabilizing forces in the form of arbitrary knowledge organization systems.

Our prototype system monitors a user's desktop activities after combining raw events, and then extracts possible annotation labels with LDA and C-value techniques from documents and text data in sensor events. In this paper, we introduce a lifelogging module and a lifelog annotation method based on term extraction techniques. According to an empirical evaluation for three weeks, we found that the current method is useful for one-week review.","2011-10-24","2023-09-11 23:15:28","2024-03-26 15:04:10","2023-09-11","2581–2584","","","","","","Annotating knowledge work lifelog","CIKM '11","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","en","","","","","ACM Digital Library","","1 citations (Crossref) [2024-03-26] titleTranslation: 註釋知識工作生活日誌：從傳感器和操作歷史中提取術語 abstractTranslation:  我們提出了一個系統，支持將知識工作生活日誌作為活動歷史進行審查。由於知識工作者經常回顧自己的活動歷史，因此在他/她的終端上收集每個用戶的活動作為生活日誌是一種很有前途的方法。然而，存儲的生活日誌的可讀性是基於生活日誌的應用程序的一個大問題。我們提出了一種術語提取方法，將註釋標籤添加到存儲的生活日誌中，以支持知識工作者，利用從桌面活動獲取的文本數據。我們的原型系統在組合原始事件後監視用戶的桌面活動，然後使用 LDA 和 C 值技術從傳感器事件中的文檔和文本數據中提取可能的註釋標籤。在本文中，我們介紹了一種生活日誌模塊和一種基於術語提取技術的生活日誌註釋方法。根據三週的實證評估，我們發現目前的方法對於一周的複習是有用的。","","C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\7H4EY9X2\Okamoto 等。 - 2011 - Annotating knowledge work lifelog term extraction.pdf","","","knowledge work; lifelog; term extraction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Based on a logical form developed by extending the UML class diagram notations, a transformation model is presented to support the automatic transformation of natural language queries into relational algebra by employing appropriate natural language processing techniques and object-oriented analysis methods. The proposed logical form has the advantage that it can be mapped from natural language constructs by referring to the conceptual schema modeled by class diagrams, and can be efficiently transformed into relational algebra for query execution.

However, due to the growing amount of digital information as well as improved technical possibilities, other organization schemes such as faceted classification schemes or so-called folksonomies, the result of social tagging activity, recently gained popularity. While these approaches address particular shortcomings of purely hierarchical organization of information, they exhibit certain characteristics limiting their general applicability. In this paper, we first give an overview of the particular strengths and weaknesses of different approaches to knowledge organization. Subsequently, we present a formal model of TACKO, a novel organization scheme that is inspired by the flexibility of tagging systems, i.e., the assignment of keywords to information resources, and incorporates elements of hierarchical and faceted organization schemes, so it can be considered a synthesis of the aforementioned schemes.

However, prior researches fail to extract users' precise preferences for tags in the items due to their incomplete feature-input patterns. To convert user-item interactions to user-tag preferences, we propose a novel feature-based framework named Coalition Tag Multi-View Mapping (CTMVM), which identifies and investigates two special features, Coalition Feature and Privileged Feature. The former indicates decisive tags in each click where relationships between tags in one item are treated as a coalition game. The latter represents highly informative features that only occur during training. For the coalition feature, we adopt Shapley Value based Empowerment (SVE) to model the tags in items with a game-theoretic paradigm and charge the network to straight master user preferences for essential tags. For the privileged feature, we present Privileged Knowledge Mapping (PKM) to explicitly distill privileged feature knowledge for each tag into one single embedding, which assists the model in predicting user-tag preferences at a more fine-grained level. However, the barren capacity of single embeddings limits the diverse relations between each tag and different privileged features. Therefore, we further propose Adaptive Multi-View Mapping (AMVM) model to enhance effect by handling multiple mapping networks. Excellent offline experiment results on two public and one private datasets show the out-standing performance of CTMVM.

Scientific literature tagging is beyond a pure multi-label text classification task because papers on the Web are prevalently accompanied by metadata information such as venues, authors, and references, which may serve as additional signals to infer relevant tags. Although there have been studies making use of metadata in academic paper classification, their focus is often restricted to one or two scientific fields (e.g., computer science and biomedicine) and to one specific model. In this work, we systematically study the effect of metadata on scientific literature tagging across 19 fields. We select three representative multi-label classifiers (i.e., a bag-of-words model, a sequence-based model, and a pre-trained language model) and explore their performance change in scientific literature tagging when metadata are fed to the classifiers as additional features.

FKG is a novel concept that was firstly introduced in 2020 by integrating approximate reasoning with inference mechanism to find labels of new records, which are impossible for inference by the rule base. However, one of the key limitations of FKG is the use of a single pair to find new records’ label that leads to low performance in approximation. This paper presents a novel approach of using FKG pairs instead of a single pair as in the classical model. A novel FKG-Pairs model including a new representing method and an approximation algorithm is presented. Theoretical analysis of the FKG-Pairs model such as identification of a threshold for the best value (k∗) pairs is also investigated.

Such knowledge graphs are usually in the form of Curated Document Databases (CDDs). Domain Experts and researchers typically query such literature knowledge graphs using some form of query-resolution mechanism. Machine learning techniques can be used to automate query-resolution. This paper presents a document query-resolution mechanism, given a query and set of documents in a knowledge graph, based on a hybrid word embedding that combines knowledge graph embeddings with “traditional” embeddings. A query-document data set extracted from a clinical trials CDD (the ORRCA CDD) was used. Three “traditional” word embeddings were considered: CBOW, BERT and SciBERT. The evaluation demonstrated that hybrid embeddings produced better results than when the embedding models were used in isolation. A best Mean Average Precision of 0.486 was obtained when using a CBOW and random walk knowledge graph hybrid embedding.","2022","2023-09-12 02:37:56","2024-03-26 15:04:01","","98-111","","","","","","","Lecture Notes in Computer Science","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","0 citations (Crossref) [2024-03-26] titleTranslation: 使用混合文檔嵌入的文獻知識圖查詢解析 abstractTranslation:  文獻知識圖在幫助領域專家進行查詢解析以在已發表文獻中查找相關文章方面發揮著關鍵作用。此類知識圖通常採用策劃文檔數據庫（CDD）的形式。領域專家和研究人員通常使用某種形式的查詢解析機制來查詢此類文獻知識圖。機器學習技術可用於自動化查詢解析。本文提出了一種文檔查詢解析機制，給定知識圖中的查詢和文檔集，基於將知識圖嵌入與“傳統”嵌入相結合的混合詞嵌入。使用從臨床試驗 CDD（ORRCA CDD）中提取的查詢文檔數據集。考慮了三種“傳統”詞嵌入：CBOW、BERT 和 SciBERT。評估表明，混合嵌入比單獨使用嵌入模型產生更好的結果。使用 CBOW 和隨機遊走知識圖混合嵌入時，獲得了 0.486 的最佳平均精度。","","C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\JRRG2542\Muhammad 等。 - 2022 - Query Resolution of Literature Knowledge Graphs Us.pdf","","","Document ranking; Query resolution; Word embedding","Max Bramer; Frederic Stahl","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Currently, machine understandable domain specific healthcare knowledge curation framework does not exist for complex neurological diseases such as subarachnoid hemorrhage stroke. We envisage futuristic clinical decision support systems and tools backed with such knowledge will aide in complex neurological disease prognosis, diagnosis, and treatment. Existing knowledge graphs (KGs) only contain concepts and relationships between them and offer this knowledge to information extraction and knowledge management applications.

Causation in the written form can be referred to as a causal relation where a cause event entails the occurrence of an effect event. A cause and effect relationship is stronger than a correlation between events, and therefore aggregated causal relations extracted from large corpora can be used in numerous applications such as question-answering and summarisation to produce superior results than traditional approaches. Techniques like logical consequence allow causal relations to be used in niche practical applications such as event prediction which is useful for diverse domains such as security and finance. Until recently, the use of causal relations was a relatively unpopular technique because the causal relation extraction techniques were problematic, and the relations returned were incomplete, error prone or simplistic. The recent adoption of language models and improved relation extractors for natural language such as Transformer-XL (Dai et al. (2019). Transformer-xl: Attentive language models beyond a fixed-length context. arXiv preprint arXiv:1901.02860) has seen a surge of research interest in the possibilities of using causal relations in practical applications.

Existing causality extraction techniques include knowledge-based, statistical machine learning (ML)-based, and deep learning-based approaches. Each method has its advantages and weaknesses. For example, knowledge-based methods are understandable but require extensive manual domain knowledge and have poor cross-domain applicability. Statistical machine learning methods are more automated because of natural language processing (NLP) toolkits. However, feature engineering is labor-intensive, and toolkits may lead to error propagation. In the past few years, deep learning techniques attract substantial attention from NLP researchers because of its powerful representation learning ability and the rapid increase in computational resources. Their limitations include high computational costs and a lack of adequate annotated training data. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive survey of causality extraction. We initially introduce primary forms existing in the causality extraction: explicit intra-sentential causality, implicit causality, and inter-sentential causality.

Clear definitions or descriptions in understandable language or often not available. Therefore, generating human-readable definitions for biomedical concepts might help make the information they encode more accessible and understandable to a wider public.Objective: In this article, we introduce the Automatic Glossary of Clinical Terminology (AGCT), a large-scale biomedical dictionary of clinical concepts generated using high-quality information extracted from the biomedical knowledge contained in SnomedCT.Methods: We generate a novel definition for every SnomedCT concept, after prompting the OpenAI Turbo model, a variant of GPT 3.5, using a high-quality verbalization of the SnomedCT relationships of the to-be-defined concept. A significant subset of the generated definitions was subsequently evaluated by NLP researchers with biomedical expertise on 5-point scales along the following three axes: factuality, insight, and fluency.Results: AGCT contains 422,070 computer-generated definitions for SnomedCT concepts, covering various domains such as diseases, procedures, drugs, and anatomy. The average length of the definitions is 49 words. The definitions were assigned average scores of over 4.5 out of 5 on all three axes, indicating a majority of factual, insightful, and fluent definitions.Conclusion: AGCT is a novel and valuable resource for biomedical tasks that require human-readable definitions for SnomedCT concepts.

Existing methods explore the incorporation of information beyond text, such as document metadata or label structure. These approaches however either simply utilize the semantic information of metadata or employ the predefined parent-child label hierarchy, ignoring the heterogeneous graphical structures of metadata and labels, which we believe are crucial for accurate multi-label document classification. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel neural network based approach for multi-label document classification, in which two heterogeneous graphs are constructed and learned using heterogeneous graph transformers.

In many cases, the collaborations are technology supported, meaning that the work is done through shared documents. We develop a framework articulating the characteristics of documents supporting collaborators with access to asymmetric knowledge versus those with access to symmetric knowledge. Drawing on theories about document genre, boundary objects, and provenance, we hypothesize that documents supporting asymmetric collaborators are likely to articulate or prescribe their own (a) purpose, (b) context of use, (c) content and form, and (d) provenance in greater detail than documents supporting symmetric collaborators. We explore these hypotheses through content analysis of documents and instructions for documents from a variety of free/libre open-source projects (FLOSS). We present findings consistent with the hypotheses developed as well as results extending beyond our theory-derived assumptions. When participants have access to the same knowledge, the study suggests that prescriptions about the content of documents become less important compared with prescriptions about the context, provenance, and process of work. The study contributes with a dynamic perspective on communicative practices that consider an often-uneven distribution of knowledge in virtual collaborations.","2019","2023-09-13 09:17:23","2024-03-26 15:03:50","2023-09-13 09:17:23","619-633","","6","70","","","Documentation and access to knowledge in online communities","","","","","","","en","© 2019 The Authors.

But few inference relations from maximal consistent subsets exist. In this paper we point out new inference relations based on selection of some maximal consistent subsets, leading thus to inference relations with a stronger inferential power. The selection process must obey some principles to ensure that it leads to an inference relation which is rational. We define a general class of monotonic selection relations for comparing maximal consistent subsets and show that it corresponds to the class of rational inference relations.","2019-08-10","2023-09-13 09:38:00","2023-11-23 09:23:22","2023-09-13","1749–1755","","","","","","","IJCAI'19","","","","AAAI Press","Macao, China","","","","","","ACM Digital Library","","","","","","知識推理; 已整理; 邏輯","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We define this work as the design of ground truth schema and explore the challenges involved in the creation of datasets in the medical domain even before any annotations are made. Based on extensive work in three health-tech organisations, we describe five external and internal factors that condition medical dataset creation processes. Three external factors include regulatory constraints, the context of creation and use, and commercial and operational pressures. These factors condition medical data collection and shape the ground truth schema design. Two internal factors include epistemic differences and limits of labelling. These directly shape the design of the ground truth schema.

To reduce the effects of preeclampsia, many studies have investigated the disease, prevention, and complication. Conventional fuzzy inference techniques can solve several diagnosis problems in health such as fuzzy inference systems (FIS), and Mamdani complex fuzzy inference systems with rule reduction (M-CFIS-R), however, the computation time is quite high. Recently, the research direction of approximate inference based on fuzzy knowledge graph (FKG) has been proposed in the M-CFIS-FKG model with the combination of regimens in traditional medicine and subclinical data gathered from medical records. The paper has presented a proposed model of FKG-Pairs3 to support patients&rsquo; disease diagnosis, together with doctors&rsquo; preferences in decision-making. The proposed model has been implemented in real-world applications for disease diagnosis in traditional medicine based on input data sets with vague information, quantified by doctor&rsquo;s preferences. To validate the proposed model, it has been tested in a real-world case study of preeclampsia signs in a hospital for disease diagnosis with the traditional medicine approach. Experimental results show that the proposed model has demonstrated the model&rsquo;s effectiveness in the decision-making of preeclampsia signs.","2023","2023-09-15 09:27:26","2024-03-26 15:03:15","","","","2","14","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","0 citations (Crossref) [2024-03-26] titleTranslation: 基於模糊知識圖對的決策分類應用：子癇前症體徵的案例研究 abstractTranslation:  子癇前症的徵兆診斷問題大多基於症狀數據，其特徵是定期收集的數據具有不確定性、模糊性和產科醫生意見。為了減少子癇前症的影響，許多研究調查了疾病、預防和併發症。傳統的模糊推理技術可以解決健康中的多種診斷問題，例如模糊推理系統（FIS）和規則縮減的Mamdani複雜模糊推理系統（M-CFIS-R），但計算時間相當長。最近，結合傳統醫學的治療方案和從病歷中收集的亞臨床數據，在M-CFIS-FKG模型中提出了基於模糊知識圖（FKG）的近似推理的研究方向。該論文提出了一個 FKG-Pairs3 模型來支持患者的疾病診斷以及醫生的決策偏好。所提出的模型已在傳統醫學疾病診斷的現實應用中實現，該應用基於具有模糊資訊的輸入資料集，並根據醫生的偏好進行量化。為了驗證所提出的模型，它已經在醫院的子癇前症症狀的真實案例研究中進行了測試，以使用傳統醫學方法進行疾病診斷。實驗結果表明，所提出的模型證明了該模型在子癇前症決策方面的有效性。","","C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\GGCH9QMQ\Pham 等。 - 2023 - A Fuzzy Knowledge Graph Pairs-Based Application fo.pdf","","decision making; disease diagnosis; FKG-Pairs; fuzzy knowledge graph; preeclampsia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we examine the computational ability of Boolean decision trees for the explanation purpose. We focus on both abductive explanations (suited to explaining why a given instance has been classified as such by the decision tree at hand) and on contrastive explanations (suited to explaining why a given instance has not been classified by the decision tree as it was expected). More precisely, we are interested in deriving, minimizing, and counting abductive explanations and contrastive explanations. We prove that the set of all irredundant abductive explanations (also known as PI-explanations or sufficient reasons) for an instance given a decision tree can be exponentially larger than the size of the input (the instance and the decision tree). Therefore, generating the full set of sufficient reasons for an instance can be out of reach. In addition, deriving a single sufficient reason, though computationally easy when dealing with decision trees, does not prove enough in general; indeed, two sufficient reasons for the same instance may differ on many features. To deal with this issue and generate synthetic views of the set of all sufficient reasons, we define notions of relevant features and of necessary features that characterize the (possibly negated) features appearing in at least one or in every sufficient reason for an instance, and we show that they can be computed in polynomial time. We also introduce the notion of explanatory importance, that indicates how frequent each (possibly negated) feature is in the set of all sufficient reasons. We show how the explanatory importance of a (possibly negated) feature and the number of sufficient reasons for an instance can be obtained via a model counting operation, which turns out to be practical in many cases. We also explain how to enumerate minimum-size sufficient reasons. We finally show that, unlike sufficient reasons, the set of all contrastive explanations for an instance given a decision tree can be derived, minimized and counted in polynomial time.","2022-11-01","2023-09-13 07:50:16","2024-03-26 15:03:54","2023-09-13 07:50:16","102088","","","142","","Data & Knowledge Engineering","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","10 citations (Crossref) [2024-03-26] titleTranslation: 論布爾決策樹的解釋力 abstractTranslation:  決策樹長期以來被認為是可解釋性至關重要的敏感應用中的首選模型。在本文中，我們出於解釋目的檢查了布林決策樹的計算能力。我們關注溯因解釋（適合於解釋為什麼給定的實例已被當前的決策樹分類）和對比解釋（適合於解釋為什麼給定的實例沒有按預期被決策樹分類） ）。更準確地說，我們感興趣的是推導、最小化和計算溯因解釋和對比解釋。我們證明，對於給定決策樹的實例，所有不冗餘的溯因解釋（也稱為 PI 解釋或充分理由）的集合可以以指數方式大於輸入（實例和決策樹）的大小。因此，為一個實例產生全套充分理由可能是遙不可及的。此外，雖然在處理決策樹時計算起來很容易，但推導出一個充分的理由在一般情況下還不夠。事實上，同一實例的兩個充分理由可能在許多特徵上有所不同。為了處理這個問題並產生所有充分理由集的綜合視圖，我們定義了相關特徵和必要特徵的概念，這些特徵描述了在實例的至少一個或每個充分理由中出現的（可能否定的）特徵，並且我們證明它們可以在多項式時間內計算出來。我們也引入了解釋重要性的概念，它顯示每個（可能被否定的）特徵在所有充分理由的集合中出現的頻率。我們展示瞭如何透過模型計數操作來獲得（可能被否定的）特徵的解釋重要性以及實例的充分理由的數量，這在許多情況下都是實用的。我們也解釋瞭如何列舉最小尺寸的充分理由。我們最終表明，與充分理由不同，給定決策樹的實例的所有對比解釋的集合可以在多項式時間內導出、最小化和計數。","","C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\WP8A3GGV\Audemard 等。 - 2022 - On the explanatory power of Boolean decision trees.pdf; C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\SMQIMVQF\S0169023X22000799.html","","決策樹; 機器學習; 已整理; 可解釋性","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Unlike chit-chat dialogue models, task-oriented dialogue models fulfill at least two task-specific modules: dialogue state tracker (DST) and response generator (RG). The dialogue state consists of the domain-slot-value triples, which are regarded as the user's constraints to search the domain-related databases. The large-scale task-oriented dialogue data with the annotated structured dialogue state usually are inaccessible. It prevents the development of the pretrained language model for the task-oriented dialogue. We propose a simple yet effective pretraining method to alleviate this problem, which consists of two pretraining phases. The first phase is to pretrain on large-scale contextual text data, where the structured information of the text is extracted by the information extracting tool. To bridge the gap between the pretraining method and downstream tasks, we design two pretraining tasks: ontology-like triple recovery and next-text generation, which simulates the DST and RG, respectively. The second phase is to fine-tune the pretrained model on the TOD data. The experimental results show that our proposed method achieves an exciting boost and get competitive performance even without any TOD data on CamRest676 and MultiWOZ benchmarks.","2023-01-12","2023-09-15 06:31:57","2024-03-26 15:03:16","2023-09-15 06:31:57","68-84","","","11","","","OPAL","","","","","","","en","Copyright (c) 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics","","","","transacl.org","","2 citations (Crossref) [2024-03-26] titleTranslation: OPAL：用於端到端任務導向對話的本體感知預訓練語言模型 abstractTranslation:  本文提出了一種用於端到端任務導向對話（TOD）的本體感知預訓練語言模型（OPAL）。與閒聊對話模型不同，以任務為導向的對話模型至少實現兩個特定於任務的模組：對話狀態追蹤器（DST）和回應產生器（RG）。對話狀態由領域-插槽-值三元組組成，被視為使用者搜尋領域相關資料庫的限制。帶有註釋的結構化對話狀態的大規模面向任務的對話資料通常是無法存取的。它阻止了面向任務的對話的預訓練語言模型的發展。我們提出了一種簡單而有效的預訓練方法來緩解這個問題，該方法由兩個預訓練階段組成。第一階段是對大規模情境文字資料進行預先訓練，其中透過資訊擷取工具提取文字的結構化資訊。為了彌合預訓練方法和下游任務之間的差距，我們設計了兩個預訓練任務：類本體三元組恢復和下文本生成，分別模擬 DST 和 RG。第二階段是在 TOD 資料上微調預訓練模型。實驗結果表明，即使在 CamRest676 和 MultiWOZ 基準上沒有任何 TOD 數據，我們提出的方法也能實現令人興奮的提升並獲得有競爭力的性能。","","","","機器學習; 知識本體; 已讀; 監督式學習","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DartQuery is an ontology-based query interface helping user to construct semantic queries, and capable of rewriting SPARQL semantic queries to a set of SQL queries. DartSearch is an ontology-based search engine enabling user to make full-text search over all databases and to navigate across the search results semantically. It is also enriched with a concept ranking mechanism to enable user to find more accurate and reliable results.

Unlike conventional knowledge bases, LMs implicitly memorize knowledge in their parameters, which makes it harder to correct if some knowledge is incorrectly inferred or obsolete. The task of Knowledge Editing is to correct errors in language models, avoiding the expensive overhead associated with retraining the model from scratch. While existing methods have shown some promising results, they fail on multi-edits as they ignore the conflicts between these edits. In the paper, we propose a novel framework to divide-and-conquer edits with parallel Editors. Specifically, we design explicit and implicit multi-editor models to learn diverse editing strategies in terms of dynamic structure and dynamic parameters respectively, which allows solving the conflict data in an efficient end-to-end manner. Our main findings are: (i) State of the art Knowledge Editing methods with multiple editing capability, such as MEND and ENN, can hardly outperform the fine-tuning method; (ii) Our proposed models outperform the fine-tuning method over the two widely used datasets for Knowledge Editing; (iii) Additional analytical experiments verify that our approach can learn diverse editing strategies, thus better adapting to multiple editing than state-of-the-art methods.","2023-11-04","2023-09-13 11:11:51","2024-03-26 15:03:27","2023-09-13 11:11:51","110826","","","279","","Knowledge-Based Systems","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","1 citations (Crossref) [2024-03-26] titleTranslation: 知識編輯的分而治之框架 abstractTranslation:  由於預訓練語言模型 (LM) 在各種自然語言處理 (NLP) 任務中發揮重要作用，因此確保從 LM 學到的知識有效且正確變得越來越重要。與傳統的知識庫不同，語言模型隱式地記憶其參數中的知識，如果某些知識被錯誤推斷或過時，則更難糾正。知識編輯的任務是糾正語言模型中的錯誤，避免與從頭開始重新訓練模型相關的昂貴開銷。雖然現有方法已經顯示出一些有希望的結果，但它們在多重編輯上失敗了，因為它們忽略了這些編輯之間的衝突。在本文中，我們提出了一種新穎的框架，用於使用平行編輯器進行分而治之的編輯。具體來說，我們設計了顯式和隱式多編輯器模型，分別在動態結構和動態參數方面學習不同的編輯策略，這使得能夠以有效的端到端方式解決衝突資料。我們的主要發現是：（i）具有多種編輯能力的最先進的知識編輯方法，例如 MEND 和 ENN，很難優於微調方法； (ii) 我們提出的模型在兩個廣泛使用的知識編輯資料集上優於微調方法； （iii）額外的分析實驗驗證了我們的方法可以學習不同的編輯策略，從而比最先進的方法更好地適應多重編輯。","","C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\D6G2RP7N\Han 等。 - 2023 - A divide and conquer framework for Knowledge Editi.pdf; C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\UNEZ2UTZ\S0950705123005762.html","","數學; 已整理; 預訓練; 框架; 模型編輯","Dynamantic interfence","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI), its implementation into acupuncture has achieved a series of significant breakthroughs in many areas of acupuncture practice, such as acupoints selection and prescription, acupuncture manipulation identification, acupuncture efficacy prediction, and so on. The paper will discuss the significant theoretical and technical achievements in AI-directed acupuncture. AI-based data mining methods uncovered crucial acupoint combinations for treating various diseases, which provide a scientific basis for acupoints prescription in clinical practice. Furthermore, the rapid development of modern TCM instruments facilitates the integration of modern medical instruments, AI techniques, and acupuncture. This integration significantly improves the quantification, objectification, and standardization of acupuncture as well as the delivery of clinical personalized acupuncture therapy. Machine learning-based clinical efficacy prediction of acupuncture can help doctors screen patients who may benefit from acupuncture treatment. However, the existing challenges require additional work for developing AI-directed acupuncture. Some include a better understanding of ancient Chinese philosophy for AI researchers, TCM acupuncture theory-based explanation of the knowledge discoveries, construction of acupuncture databases, and clinical trials for novel knowledge validation.

In the first place, machine learning will be utilized in the effective chemical components of natural products to target the pathological molecules of the disease which could achieve the purpose of screening the natural products on the basis of the pathological mechanisms they target. In this approach, computational simulations will be used for processing the data for effective chemical components, generating datasets for analyzing features. In the next step, machine learning will be used to analyze the datasets on the basis of TCM theories such as the superposition of syndrome elements. Finally, interdisciplinary natural product-syndrome research will be established by unifying the results of the two steps outlined above, potentially realizing an intelligent artificial intelligence diagnosis and treatment model based on the effective chemical components of natural products under the guidance of TCM theory.

The issues of collecting and extracting personal life events have emerged. People often share their life experiences with others through conversations. However, extracting life events from conversations is rarely explored. In this paper, we present Life Event Dialog, a dataset containing fine-grained life event annotations on conversational data. In addition, we initiate a novel conversational life event extraction task and differentiate the task from the public event extraction or the life event extraction from other sources like microblogs. We explore three information extraction (IE) frameworks to address the conversational life event extraction task: OpenIE, relation extraction, and event extraction. A comprehensive empirical analysis of the three baselines is established. The results suggest that the current event extraction model still struggles with extracting life events from human daily conversations.

Automatic construction of personal ontologies is difficult in part because measuring the semantic distance between two concepts is difficult. Knowledge-based approaches use either knowledge bases, such as WordNet, or lexico-syntactic patterns to induce the differences between concepts. However, these techniques are only applicable for a subset of concepts and leave the majority unmeasurable. On the other hand, statistical approaches are able to induce the differences between any concept pair but lack of human knowledge involvement and hence suffer from low precision. In the context of personal ontology construction, semantic distances between concepts need to reflect personal preferences. Based on that, this paper presents a supervised hierarchical clustering framework to incorporate personal preferences for distance metric learning in personal ontology construction. In this framework, periodic manual guidance provides training data for learning a distance metric and the learned metric is used during automatic activities to further construct the ontology. A detailed user study demonstrates that the approach is effective and accelerates the construction of personal ontologies.","2008-10-30","2023-09-16 08:35:40","2024-03-26 15:02:54","2023-09-16","17–24","","","","","","","ONISW '08","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","en","","","","","ACM Digital Library","","5 citations (Crossref) [2024-03-26] abstractTranslation:  個人本體建構是對相關資料進行整理，確定主要主題和概念，並根據個人需求進行組織的任務。自動建立個人本體很困難，部分原因是測量兩個概念之間的語意距離很困難。基於知識的方法使用知識庫（例如 WordNet）或詞彙句法模式來歸納概念之間的差異。然而，這些技術僅適用於一部分概念，而大多數概念無法測量。另一方面，統計方法能夠歸納任何概念對之間的差異，但缺乏人類知識的參與，因此精度較低。在個人本體建構的脈絡下，概念之間的語意距離需要反映個人偏好。在此基礎上，本文提出了一個有監督的層次聚類框架，將個人對距離度量學習的偏好納入個人本體建構中。在此框架中，定期手動指導提供用於學習距離測量的訓練數據，並且在自動活動期間使用學習到的測量來進一步建立本體。詳細的使用者研究表明該方法是有效的，並加速了個人本體的建構。 titleTranslation: 學習個人本體中的距離測量","","C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\2VXUZG9S\Yang 與 Callan - 2008 - Learning the distance metric in a personal ontolog.pdf","","機器學習; 知識本體; 人機互動; 嵌入; 已整理; 可解釋性","/unread; supervised hierarchical clustering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Personal Knowledge Management Applications (PKMAs) help us save and organize relevant and worth-remembering digital information. Thus, PKMAs serve as an external memory prosthesis but with the innate risk of substituting our organic memory. Our results from an online survey (N = 58) on user motivation for PKMAs show that users rarely revisit their digitally saved content. As a result, any memory about previously obtained knowledge naturally attenuates over time. However, being able to recall from one’s organic memory is pivotal for creative processes such as brainstorming and the successful integration of new information. We propose endowing PKMAs with a memory-augmentation feature that periodically reminds one (e.g., on one’s mobile device) to revisit stored content for counteracting long-term forgetting. Periodic revisiting may consolidate the memory recall of the stored information, and thus the memory about saved information becomes gradually augmented. To address the specific requirements of reminders in PKMS, we conducted a follow-up focus group (N = 7) to discuss potential design features, in particular in regards to timing and presentation format. Ultimately, we elicit a set of design principles for future PKMAs that support memory augmentation.","2021-05-28","2023-09-16 08:32:28","2024-03-26 15:02:55","2023-09-16","1–5","","","","","","","AH2021","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","en","","","","","ACM Digital Library","","0 citations (Crossref) [2024-03-26] titleTranslation: 個人知識管理應用程式中的長期記憶增強設計 abstractTranslation:  在我們的數位化世界中，我們越來越依賴科技來記憶。個人知識管理應用程式 (PKMA) 可協助我們保存和組織相關且值得記住的數位資訊。因此，PKMA 作為外在記憶假體，但具有取代我們的有機記憶的固有風險。我們對 PKMA 使用者動機的線上調查 (N = 58) 結果顯示，使用者很少重新造訪他們以數位方式保存的內容。結果，任何關於先前獲得的知識的記憶都會隨著時間的推移而自然減弱。然而，能夠回憶起一個人的有機記憶對於集思廣益和成功整合新資訊等創造性過程至關重要。我們建議賦予 PKMA 一種記憶增強功能，定期提醒人們（例如，在行動裝置上）重新存取儲存的內容，以防止長期遺忘。定期重溫可以鞏固已儲存資訊的記憶回憶，從而對已儲存資訊的記憶逐漸增強。為了解決 PKMS 中提醒的具體要求，我們進行了後續焦點小組 (N = 7) 來討論潛在的設計功能，特別是在時間和演示格式方面。最終，我們為未來支援記憶體增強的 PKMA 提出了一套設計原則。","","C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\HCJPIFJ7\Schneegass 等。 - 2021 - Design for Long-term Memory Augmentation in Person.pdf","","知識系統; 已整理; 使用者調查","/unread; memory augmentation; notification; Personal knowledge management applications; reminder","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Among these fundamentals, Biomedical Named Entity Recognition (BioNER) and Biomedical Relation Extraction (BioRE) are the most essential in analysing the literature. In the biomedical domain, Knowledge Graph is used to visualize the relationships between various entities such as proteins, chemicals and diseases. Scientific publications have increased dramatically as a result of the search for treatments and potential cures for the new Coronavirus, but efficiently analysing, integrating, and utilising related sources of information remains a difficulty. In order to effectively combat the disease during pandemics like COVID-19, literature must be used quickly and effectively. In this paper, we introduced a fully automated framework consists of BERT-BiLSTM, Knowledge graph, and Representation Learning model to extract the top diseases, chemicals, and proteins related to COVID-19 from the literature. The proposed framework uses Named Entity Recognition models for disease recognition, chemical recognition, and protein recognition. Then the system uses the Chemical - Disease Relation Extraction and Chemical - Protein Relation Extraction models. And the system extracts the entities and relations from the CORD-19 dataset using the models. The system then creates a Knowledge Graph for the extracted relations and entities. The system performs Representation Learning on this KG to get the embeddings of all entities and get the top related diseases, chemicals, and proteins with respect to COVID-19. Display Omitted • A BERT-BiLSTM-CRF model to identify the biomedical named entities. • A SciBERT model to extract the relations between the biomedical entities. • Creating a Knowledge Graph for the COVID – 19 with entities as nodes and relations as edges. • Use of Representation Learning to identify top related drugs, disease and proteins for COVID – 19.","2023-02-01","2023-09-16 07:56:38","2024-03-26 15:03:01","2023-09-16 07:56:38","","","C","102","","Comput.

From an empirical perspective, it is not yet well understood, which particular aspects in the ontology are reasoner performance degrading factors. In this paper, we conducted an investigation about state of art works that attempted to portray potential correlation between reasoner empirical behaviour and particular ontological features.

A FV reflects the semantic and linguistic neighbourhoods of a particular entity. The semantic neighbourhood is derived from an ontology and is based on related entities and specified properties, while linguistic neighbourhood is based on co-location of terms in a text corpus. Later, during the search process the FVs are used to filter and rerank the search results of the underlying search engine and thereby increasing the precision of the result. We elaborate on the approach and describe how the FVs are constructed. Then we report on a conducted evaluation where we analyse the sensitivity of the approach w.r.t. ontology quality and search tasks.

Alongside automation, quality evaluation of enriched ontologies can impact software reliability and reuse. Current quality evaluation approaches oftentimes seek to evaluate ontologies in either syntactic (degree of following ontology development guidelines) or semantic (degree of semantic validity of enriched concepts/relations) aspects. This paper proposes an ontology quality evaluation framework consisting of: (a) SynEvaluator and (b) SemValidator for evaluating syntactic and semantic aspects of ontologies respectively. SynEvaluator allows dynamic task-specific creation and updation of syntactic rules at run-time without any need for programming. SemValidator uses Twitter-based expertise of validators for semantic evaluation.

However, evaluating whether or not ontology assertions correspond to the real world remains a manual and time-consuming task. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of using microtask crowdsourcing through Amazon Mechanical Turk to evaluate ontologies. Specifically, we look at the task of verifying the subclass--superclass hierarchy in ontologies. We demonstrate that the performance of Amazon Mechanical Turk workers (turkers) on this task is comparable to the performance of undergraduate students in a formal study. We explore the effects of the type of the ontology on the performance of turkers and demonstrate that turkers can achieve accuracy as high as 90% on verifying hierarchy statements form common-sense ontologies such as WordNet. Finally, we compare the performance of turkers to the performance of domain experts on verifying statements from an ontology in the biomedical domain.

However, information imprecision and uncertainty exist in many real-world applications, thus constructing fuzzy ontology by extracting domain knowledge from fuzzy database models (e.g., fuzzy ER model) can profitably support fuzzy ontology development. In this paper, we propose an approach for constructing fuzzy ontology from fuzzy ER model, in which the fuzzy ontology consists of fuzzy ontology structure and instances. Firstly, we give the formal definition and the semantics of fuzzy ER models. Then, we introduce the fuzzy extension of ontology language OWL DL, i.e., fuzzy OWL DL. Based on the fuzzy OWL DL, a kind of fuzzy ontology called fuzzy OWL DL ontology is presented. Furthermore, we consider the fuzzy ER schema and the corresponding database instances, and translate them into the fuzzy ontology structure and the fuzzy ontology instances, respectively. Finally, since a fuzzy OWL DL ontology is equivalent to a fuzzy Description Logic f-SHOIN(D) knowledge base, how the reasoning problems of fuzzy ER models (e.g., satisfiability, subsumption, and redundancy) may be reduced to reasoning on f-SHOIN(D) knowledge bases is investigated, which will further contribute to constructing fuzzy OWL DL ontology that exactly meet application's needs. Of course, the correctness of the translation and reasoning problems are proved completely.","2010-12-01","2023-09-16 06:02:55","2024-03-26 15:03:09","","397–412","","4","8","","Web Intelli. and Agent Sys.","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ACM Digital Library","","8 citations (Crossref) [2024-03-26] abstractTranslation:  本體是語意Web W3C標準的重要組成部分，如何快速、廉價地建構Web本體已成為實現語意Web的關鍵技術。然而，許多現實應用中存在資訊不精確和不確定性，因此透過從模糊資料庫模型（例如模糊ER模型）中提取領域知識來建立模糊本體可以有效地支援模糊本體的開發。在本文中，我們提出了一種從模糊ER模型建立模糊本體的方法，其中模糊本體由模糊本體結構和實例組成。首先，我們給了模糊ER模型的形式定義和語意。然後，我們介紹了本體語言OWL DL的模糊擴展，即模糊OWL DL。在模糊OWL DL的基礎上，提出了一種模糊本體，稱為模糊OWL DL本體。此外，我們考慮模糊ER模式和對應的資料庫實例，並將它們分別轉換為模糊本體結構和模糊本體實例。最後，由於模糊OWL DL 本體相當於模糊描述邏輯f-SHOIN(D) 知識庫，因此模糊ER 模型的推理問題（例如可滿足性、包含性和冗餘性）如何可以簡化為f-SHOIN(D ) 上的推理對SHOIN(D)知識庫進行了研究，這將進一步有助於建立完全滿足應用需求的模糊OWL DL本體。當然，翻譯和推理問題的正確性都完全證明了。 titleTranslation: 從模糊 ER 模型到模糊 OWL DL 本體的形式語意保留翻譯","","","","知識本體; 無法取得; 回收","reasoning; /unread; description logic; Fuzzy database; fuzzy ER model; fuzzy OWL DL ontology; ontology learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ontological semantics directly supports such applications as machine translation of natural languages, information extraction, text summarization, question answering, advice giving, collaborative work of networks of human and software agents, etc. Ontological semantics pays serious attention to its theoretical foundations by explicating its premises; therefore, formal ontology and its relations with ontological semantics are important. Besides a general brief discussion of these relations, the paper focuses on the important theoretical and practical issue of the distinction between ontology and natural language. It is argued that this crucial distinction lies not in the (inaccurately) presumed nonambiguity of the one and the well-established ambiguity of the other but rather in the constructed and overtly defined nature of ontological concepts and labels on which no human background knowledge can operate unintentionally to introduce ambiguity, as opposed to pervasive uncontrolled and uncontrollable ambiguity in natural language. The emphasis on this distinction, we argue, will provide better theoretical support for the central tenets of formal ontology by freeing it from the Wittgensteinian and Rortyan retreats from the analytical paradigm; it also reinforces the methodology of NLP by maintaining a productive demarcation between the language-independent nature of ontology and language-specific nature of the lexicons, a demarcation that has paid off well in consecutive implementations of ontological semantics and their applications in practical computer systems.","2001-10-17","2023-09-16 06:00:50","2024-03-26 15:03:10","2023-09-15","151–161","","","","","","","FOIS '01","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","en","","","","","ACM Digital Library","","21 citations (Crossref) [2024-03-26] abstractTranslation:  本體語義學是一種自然語言意義理論，是一種自然語言處理（NLP）方法，它以本體為中心資源，提取和表示自然語言文本的意義，推理文本中的知識並生成自然語言文本基於其含義的表示。本體語義直接支援自然語言的機器翻譯、資訊提取、文本摘要、問答、建議、人類和軟體代理網絡的協作工作等應用。本體語義透過闡明其前提來認真關注其理論基礎。 ;因此，形式本體論及其與本體語義學的關係非常重要。除了對這些關係進行一般性簡要討論外，本文還重點討論了本體論與自然語言之間的區別這一重要的理論和實踐問題。有人認為，這種關鍵區別不在於一個（不準確地）假定的非歧義性和另一個的既定的歧義性，而在於構建的和公開定義的本體概念和標籤的本質，人類背景知識無法對其進行操作無意中引入歧義，而不是自然語言中普遍存在的不受控制和無法控制的歧義。我們認為，對這種差異的強調將為形式本體論的中心原則提供更好的理論支持，使形式本體論擺脫維根斯坦和羅蒂安對分析範式的退縮。它還透過在本體的獨立於語言的性質和詞典的語言特定的性質之間保持有效的劃分來強化NLP 的方法論，這種劃分在本體語義的連續實現及其在實際計算機系統中的應用中得到了很好的回報。 titleTranslation: 本體語意、形式本體與歧義","","C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\VSU33VTR\Nirenburg 與 Raskin - 2001 - Ontological semantics, formal ontology, and ambigu.pdf","","知識本體; 已整理; 語意分析; 基礎理論","/unread","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Existing machine-centric studies employ direct modification or text-based re-synthesis to de-identify users' voices but cause inconsistent audibility for human participants in emerging online communication scenarios, such as virtual meetings. In this paper, we propose a human-centric voice de-identification system, VoiceCloak, which uses adversarial examples to balance the privacy and utility of voice services. Instead of typical additive examples inducing perceivable distortions, we design a novel convolutional adversarial example that modulates perturbations into real-world room impulse responses. Benefiting from this, VoiceCloak could preserve user identity from exposure by Automatic Speaker Identification (ASI), while remaining the voice perceptual quality for non-intrusive de-identification. Moreover, VoiceCloak learns a compact speaker distribution through a conditional variational auto-encoder to synthesize diverse targets on demand. Guided by these pseudo targets, VoiceCloak constructs adversarial examples in an input-specific manner, enabling any-to-any identity transformation for robust de-identification. Experimental results show that VoiceCloak could achieve over 92% and 84% successful de-identification on mainstream ASIs and commercial systems with excellent voiceprint consistency, speech integrity, and audio quality.","2023-06-12","2023-09-16 02:49:03","2024-03-26 15:03:13","2023-09-16 02:49:03","48:1–48:21","","2","7","","Proc.

However, the lack of a consistent evaluation methodology is limiting towards a holistic understanding of the efficacy of such models. SUPERB was a step towards introducing a common benchmark to evaluate pre-trained models across various speech tasks. In this paper, we introduce SUPERB-SG, a new benchmark focusing on evaluating the semantic and generative capabilities of pre-trained models by increasing task diversity and difficulty over SUPERB. We use a lightweight methodology to test the robustness of representations learned by pre-trained models under shifts in data domain and quality across different types of tasks.

Since the incident reports on signaling failure intrinsically reflect the generation and evolution mechanism of equipment failures, relying on text mining technology, this paper tries to extract failure-related entities and constructs a knowledge graph to clarify the negative impact of the on-site electromagnetic environment. Firstly, based on convolutional neural networks (CNN), a supervised deep learning model for Chinese text classification is established to generate a corpus containing only railway failures caused by EMI. Then, the bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) and bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) algorithms are adopted to build the named entity recognition (NER) model. A NER algorithm more suitable for Chinese text features is proposed through ensemble modeling, training verification, and comparative evaluation. Finally, the knowledge storage and visualization of relational graph construction based on the Neo4j database are realized according to the obtained failure-related entities.

This task of classifying each sentence in the abstract into one of a given set of discourse categories is called sequential sentence classification. Existing machine learning-based approaches to this problem consider the content of only the abstract to obtain the neural representation of each sentence, which is then labelled with a discourse category. But this ignores the semantic information offered by the discourse labels themselves. In this paper, we propose LIHT, Label Informed Hierarchical Transformers – a method for sequential sentence classification that explicitly and hierarchically exploits the semantic information in the labels to learn label-aware neural sentence representations. The hierarchical model helps to capture not only the fine-grained interactions between the discourse labels and the words in the abstract at the sentence level but also the potential dependencies that may exist in the label sequence. Thus, LIHT generates label-aware contextual sentence representations that are then labelled with a conditional random field. We evaluate LIHT on three publicly available datasets, namely, PUBMED-RCT, NICTA-PIBOSO and CSAbstract. The incremental gain in F1-score in all the three cases over the respective state-of-the-art approaches is around 1%. Though the gains are modest, LIHT establishes a new performance benchmark for this task and is a novel technique of independent interest. We also perform an ablation study to identify the contribution of each component of LIHT in the observed performance, and a case study to visualize the roles of the different components of our model.","2023","2023-09-18 04:54:04","2024-03-26 15:02:45","2023-09-18 04:54:04","e13238","","6","40","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","","","","Wiley Online Library","","0 citations (Crossref) [2024-03-26] _eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/exsy.13238 titleTranslation: 標籤知情分層轉換器，用於科學摘要中的順序句子分類 abstractTranslation:  將科學摘要細分為背景、目標、方法、結果和結論等話語類別對於許多下游任務（如搜尋、推薦和總結）很有用。將摘要中的每個句子分類為一組給定的語篇類別之一的任務稱為順序句子分類。現有的基於機器學習的解決此問題的方法僅考慮摘要的內容以獲得每個句子的神經表示，然後用話語類別進行標記。但這忽略了話語標籤本身所提供的語意資訊。在本文中，我們提出了LIHT，即標籤知情分層變換器（Label Informed Hierarchical Transformers）——一種用於順序句子分類的方法，它明確地、分層地利用標籤中的語義資訊來學習標籤感知的神經句子表示。層次模型不僅有助於捕捉句子層級的話語標籤與摘要中的單字之間的細粒度交互，還有助於捕捉標籤序列中可能存在的潛在依賴關係。因此，LIHT 產生標籤感知的上下文句子表示，然後用條件隨機場進行標記。我們在三個公開可用的資料集（即 PUBMED-RCT、NICTA-PIBOSO 和 CSAbstract）上評估 LIHT。在所有三種情況下，相對於各自最先進的方法，F1 分數的增量增益約為 1%。儘管收益不大，但 LIHT 為這項任務建立了新的效能基準，並且是一項獨立感興趣的新技術。我們還進行了消融研究，以確定 LIHT 每個組件在觀察到的表現中的貢獻，並進行了一個案例研究，以可視化我們模型的不同組件的作用。","","C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\C4U9FF7X\exsy.html","","文字處理; 已整理; 語意分析","scholarly data; discourse segmentation; hierarchical transformers; scientific abstracts; sequential sentence classification","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To this end, we propose Document-level Attention for Keyphrase Extraction (DAKE), which comprises Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory networks that capture hidden semantics in text, a document-level attention mechanism to incorporate document level contextual information, gating mechanisms which help to determine the influence of additional contextual information on the fusion with local contextual information, and Conditional Random Fields which capture output label dependencies.

This framework aims to solve the problem of ineffective knowledge transfer that is encountered in the management of construction project knowledge sharing. First, to discover the relationship among knowledge and further obtain the relationships among projects, we design a domain knowledge graph ontology for construction projects and build an example. Then, based on this domain knowledge graph and combining construction data distance distribution with construction project knowledge background, we design a new construction project similarity measurement algorithm (PBG-MMD), which can guide the selection of the knowledge transfer source domain. Finally, a new transfer learning method is developed to automatically select the transfer source domain according to the domain context. The framework provides an effective answer for the problem of “what to transfer” in transfer learning and provides an effective solution to address the problem of “how to transfer” during knowledge transfer.

At present, the lack of an accurate representation model for design codes leads to difficulties in representing the implicit information, nested logic, and complex relations contained in high-complexity clauses in codes. To address this problem, this research establishes a new representation model based on knowledge graph (KG). Four schemas are proposed into the model including order, complex, event and integration schemas. Further, an accompanying methodology for semi-automatic construction of design code KG (DCKG) is proposed. It includes four parts: interpretation, reconstruction, organization, and implementation.

Existing methods for pruning inaccurate or out-of-domain information from knowledge graphs often rely on topological graph-pruning strategies. However, these approaches have two major drawbacks: they may discard logical structure and semantic information, and they allow multiple inheritance. To address these limitations, this study introduces KGPruning, which is a novel approach that can effectively clean and prune noisy knowledge graphs by guiding tasks with a given set of concepts and automatically generating a domain-specific taxonomy. Specifically, KGPruning employs a graph hierarchy inference method that is based on the Agony model to precisely identify and eliminate noisy entries while striving to preserve the underlying hierarchy of semantic relations as much as possible. Furthermore, to establish a tree-structured taxonomy, KGPruning integrates semantic relations and structural characteristics to effectively eliminate out-of-domain information and multiple inheritance. Through extensive experimental evaluations conducted on open benchmark datasets as well as large-scale real-world problems, the superior performance of KGPruning over state-of-the-art methods is demonstrated on the task of pruning noisy knowledge graphs.","2023-10-01","2023-09-18 05:23:04","2024-03-26 15:02:39","2023-09-18 05:23:04","119406","","","646","","Information Sciences","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","1 citations (Crossref) [2024-03-26] titleTranslation: 任務驅動的噪音知識圖譜清理與剪枝 abstractTranslation:  許多知識圖譜，尤其是那些協作或自動生成的知識圖譜，很容易出現雜訊和跨域條目，這可能會阻礙特定領域的應用程式。現有的從知識圖中修剪不準確或域外資訊的方法通常依賴拓樸圖修剪策略。然而，這些方法有兩個主要缺點：它們可能會丟棄邏輯結構和語義訊息，並且它們允許多重繼承。為了解決這些限制，本研究引入了 KGPruning，這是一種新穎的方法，可以透過使用給定的概念集來指導任務並自動生成特定於領域的分類法來有效地清理和修剪嘈雜的知識圖。具體來說，KGPruning 採用基於 Agony 模型的圖層次推理方法來精確識別和消除噪音條目，同時盡可能保留底層語義關係的層次結構。此外，為了建立樹狀結構的分類法，KGPruning整合了語意關係和結構特徵，有效消除了域外資訊和多重繼承。透過對開放基準資料集以及大規模現實世界問題進行廣泛的實驗評估，KGPruning 在修剪雜訊知識圖的任務上優於最先進的方法。","","C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\YQVI8RLF\S002002552300991X.html; C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\ATD4GKC5\Wu et al. - 2023 - Task-driven cleaning and pruning of noisy knowledg.pdf","","機器學習; 已整理; 知識衝突; 知識分享; 本體驗證","Knowledge graph pruning; Multiple inheritance; Noisy knowledge graph; Taxonomy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Yin and Yang in harmonious balance indicate health, whereas imbalances to either side indicate unhealthiness, which may result in diseases. Yin-yang disharmony is considered to be the cause of pathological changes. Syndrome differentiation of yin-yang is crucial to clinical diagnosis. It lays a foundation for subsequent medical judgments, including therapeutic methods, and formula, among many others. However, because of the complexities of the mechanisms and manifestations of disease, it is difficult to exactly point out which one, yin or yang, is disharmonious. There has been inadequate research conducted on syndrome differentiation of yin and yang from a computational perspective. In this study, we present a computational method, viz. an end-to-end syndrome differentiation of yin deficiency and yang deficiency. Methods.Unlike most previous studies on syndrome differentiation, which use structured datasets, this study takes unstructured texts in medical records as its inputs. It models syndrome differentiation as a task of text classification. This study experiments on two state-of-the-art end-to-end algorithms for text classification, i.e. a classic convolutional neural network (CNN) and fastText. These two systems take the n-grams of several types of tokens as their inputs, including characters, terms, and words. Results.When evaluated on a data set with 7326 modern medical records in TCM, it is observed that CNN and fastText generally give rise to comparable performances. The best accuracy rate of 92.55% comes from the system taking inputs as raw as n-grams of characters. It implies that one can build at least a moderate system for the differentiation of yin deficiency and yang deficiency even if he has no glossary or tokenizer at hand.

The domain of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is used as a workbench in this study, because this domain is knowledge-rich and has a large-scale domain ontology with well-defined entity types and relation types. This article releases a dataset, named “TCMSem”, to capture TCM domain experts’ intuitions of semantic relatedness. This data set is designed to cover the medical entities and relations with as many semantic types as possible so as to initiate a diverse and comprehensive evaluation on word embeddings. Experimental results show that word embeddings have demonstrated higher proficiencies in the detection of synonyms and collocations than other types of semantic relations. Furthermore, the semantic relatedness of thousands of terms of major categories in TCM is visualized using the taxonomy defined in the ontology.","2019-06-28","2023-09-18 05:28:11","2024-03-26 15:02:35","2023-09-17","764–775","","","","","","","","","","","Springer-Verlag","Berlin, Heidelberg","en","","","","","ACM Digital Library","","0 citations (Crossref) [2024-03-26] titleTranslation: 中醫術語的語意表示 abstractTranslation:  詞嵌入已廣泛應用於自然語言處理中的詞彙語義和神經網路。本文透過在人類建構的領域本體上進行驗證來研究使用詞嵌入技術的語義表示。本研究以中醫領域為工作平台，因為該領域知識豐富，擁有大規模的領域本體，具有明確的實體類型和關係類型。本文發布了一個名為「TCMSem」的資料集，以捕捉中醫領域專家對語意相關性的直覺。該資料集旨在涵蓋盡可能多的語義類型的醫療實體和關係，以便對詞嵌入進行多樣化和全面的評估。實驗結果表明，詞嵌入在同義詞和搭配檢測方面表現出比其他類型的語義關係更高的熟練程度。此外，使用本體中定義的分類法來視覺化中醫主要類別的數千個術語的語義相關性。","","","","中醫; 機器學習; 重要; 嵌入; 已整理","Evaluation; Semantic representation; TCMSem; Word embeddings","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The diagnosis of syndromes in traditional Chinese medicine is called syndrome differentiation. The construction of a syndrome differentiation system directly from clinical medical records using machine learning is still infeasible due to the lack of standardization of symptoms and syndromes in current clinical medical records. This article proposes a sophisticated approach to developing a syndrome differentiation system for 18 deficiency syndromes according to the knowledge of textbooks. This approach defines the syndrome differentiation problem as a membership problem of fuzzy sets. This approach designs a number of membership functions for fuzzy sets of syndromes based on a symptom grouping scheme and a symptom weighing scheme. Symptoms are grouped according to syndrome location, cause, and mechanism in the symptom grouping scheme. The symptom weighing scheme assigns exponentially decreasing weights to symptoms in each symptom group. An experimental evaluation based on a benchmark of 50 case reports shows that the proposed membership functions are very practical based on three differentiation metrics. This syndrome differentiation system can produce clinical medical records with standard symptoms and syndromes. In the future, these standard clinical medical records can be utilized to construct syndrome differentiation systems using machine learning.","2023-09","2023-09-19 05:18:07","2023-11-23 09:22:56","2023-09-19 05:18:07","1079-1100","","5","39","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Airiti","","Publisher: 社團法人中華民國計算語言學學會 titleTranslation: 基於模糊集的中醫虛證辨證 abstractTranslation:  中醫將疾病定義為一連串的證候。中醫對證候的診斷稱為辨證。由於目前臨床病歷缺乏症狀和證候的標準化，利用機器學習直接從臨床病歷建構辨證系統仍然不可行。本文提出了一種根據教科書知識發展 18 種虛證辨證系統的複雜方法。此方法將證候鑑別問題定義為模糊集合的隸屬度問題。此方法基於症狀分組方案和症狀權重方案為模糊症狀集設計了多個隸屬函數。症狀分組方案中根據症狀部位、原因和機制將症狀分組。症狀權重方案為每個症狀組中的症狀分配指數遞減的權重。基於 50 個案例報告基準的實驗評估表明，基於三個差異化指標，所提出的隸屬函數非常實用。此辨證系統可以產生具有標準症狀和證候的臨床病歷。未來，這些標準的臨床病歷可以用來利用機器學習來建構辨證系統。","","C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\T4VLI7WG\P 等。 - 2023 - Syndrome Differentiation for Deficiency Syndromes .pdf; C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\26WX3QZA\alDetailedMesh.html","","","syndrome differentiation; traditional Chinese medicine; deficiency syndromes; fuzzy sets","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We propose to organize knowledge representation strategies in LMs by the level of KB supervision provided, from no KB supervision at all to entity- and relation-level supervision.

Recently Graph Neural Network (GNN) has shown to be powerful in successfully tackling many tasks. However, there has been no attempt to exploit GNN to create taxonomies. In this paper, we propose Graph2Taxo, a GNN-based cross-domain transfer framework for the taxonomy construction task. Our main contribution is to learn the latent features of taxonomy construction from existing domains to guide the structure learning of an unseen domain. We also propose a novel method of directed acyclic graph (DAG) generation for taxonomy construction. Specifically, our proposed Graph2Taxo uses a noisy graph constructed from automatically extracted noisy hyponym hypernym candidate pairs, and a set of taxonomies for some known domains for training. The learned model is then used to generate taxonomy for a new unknown domain given a set of terms for that domain.

We release all the open resources (OpenBG benchmarks) derived from it for the community and report experimental results of KG-centric tasks. We also run up an online competition based on OpenBG benchmarks, and has attracted thousands of teams.

It aims to link the relations expressed in natural language (NL) to the corresponding ones in knowledge graph (KG). Existing methods mainly rely on the textual similarities between NL and KG to build relation links. Due to the ambiguity of NL and the incompleteness of KG, many relations in NL are implicitly expressed, and may not link to a single relation in KG, which challenges the current methods. In this paper, we propose an implicit RL method called ImRL, which links relation phrases in NL to relation paths in KG. To find proper relation paths, we propose a novel path ranking model that aligns not only textual information in the word embedding space but also structural information in the KG embedding space between relation phrases in NL and relation paths in KG. Besides, we leverage a gated mechanism with attention to inject prior knowledge from external paraphrase dictionaries to address the relation phrases with vague meaning.

Since the inputs and outputs of SKG tasks are heterogeneous, they have been studied separately by different communities, which limits systematic and compatible research on SKG. In this paper, we overcome this limitation by proposing the UnifiedSKG framework, which unifies 21 SKG tasks into a text-to-text format, aiming to promote systematic SKG research, instead of being exclusive to a single task, domain, or dataset. We use UnifiedSKG to benchmark T5 with different sizes and show that T5, with simple modifications when necessary, achieves state-of-the-art performance on almost all of the 21 tasks. We further demonstrate that multi-task prefix-tuning improves the performance on most tasks, largely improving the overall performance. UnifiedSKG also facilitates the investigation of zero-shot and few-shot learning, and we show that T0, GPT-3, and Codex struggle in zero-shot and few-shot learning for SKG. We also use UnifiedSKG to conduct a series of controlled experiments on structured knowledge encoding variants across SKG tasks.

The reasons for this are serious differences in the structure of hypertext and the Semantic Web as a superstructure above it, and the rules that circumscribed the development of the internet. Semantic search engines still do not implement semantic search in its pure form: various data organization schemes and data visualization formats make it a little easier to analyze facts, add them to databases, but do not make knowledge bases out of the latter, do not allow working with facts as with knowledge. In addition, the user interfaces of such systems tend to be either very complex or counter-intuitive. Nevertheless, there is every reason to believe that with the use of modern technologies, the ideas of semantization of the web and its content can already be improved and gradually implemented: for this it is necessary to get rid of some false expectations of semantic technologies, to direct efforts towards the development of web native formats of semantic markup and try to take advantage of the increasingly common voice input of household devices.","2022-01-01","2023-09-22 06:24:25","2024-03-26 15:02:21","2023-09-22 06:24:25","617-622","","","213","","Procedia Computer Science","Semantic Web Technologies","2022 Annual International Conference on Brain-Inspired Cognitive Architectures for Artificial Intelligence: The 13th Annual Meeting of the BICA Society","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","2 citations (Crossref) [2024-03-26] titleTranslation: 語意網路技術：問題與可能的發展途徑 abstractTranslation:  語意數位技術很有用，但實施起來卻很困難。在其存在期間，語義網的概念的應用仍然非常有限且發展極其緩慢。原因在於超文本的結構與作為其上層建築的語意網路之間的嚴重差異，以及限制網路發展的規則。語義搜尋引擎仍然沒有以純粹的形式實現語義搜尋：各種資料組織方案和資料視覺化格式使分析事實、將它們添加到資料庫變得更容易，但不能從後者中創建知識庫，不允許像對待知識一樣對待事實。此外，這類系統的使用者介面往往非常複雜或違反直覺。儘管如此，我們完全有理由相信，隨著現代技術的運用，網路及其內容的語義化理念已經可以得到完善並逐步實施：為此，有必要擺脫對語義技術的一些錯誤期望，致力於開發語義標記的網路原生格式，並嘗試利用日益常見的家用設備語音輸入。","","C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\X4P24GE9\Belozerov 與 Klimov - 2022 - Semantic Web Technologies Issues and Possible Way.pdf; C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\RZ4AYDEM\S1877050922018117.html","","重要; 待讀; 已整理; 知識管理","Ontology; OWL; Semantic Technology; RDF; FOAF; Hybrid Web; Linked Data; Logical Inference; Markup Language; Microformats; RSS; Semantic Network; Semantic Search; Semantic Web; URI","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A crucial step toward integrating audio repositories in a flexible manner is a shared basis for modelling the data therein. This paper describes and extends the Audio Commons Ontology, a common data model designed to integrate existing repositories in the audio media domain. The ontology is designed with the involvement of users through surveys and requirements analyses, and evaluated in-use, by demonstrating how it supports the integration of four relevant repositories with heterogeneous APIs and data models.

We attempt to characterize the candidate structures for code lists based on our observations in OWL ontologies. Our main contribution is then an approach implemented as a series of SPARQL queries and a lightweight web application that can be used to browse and detect potential code lists in ontologies and vocabularies, in order to extract and enhance them, and to store them in a stand-alone knowledge base. The application allows inspecting query results coming from the Linked Open Vocabularies catalog dataset. In addition, we describe a complementary bottom-up analysis of potential code lists.

Given the importance of ontologies, a significant amount of work in the literature has been done on knowledge representation on the Web which includes ontology development (ontology engineering), ontology evaluation, ontology population and ontology evolution. As a result, numerous domain ontologies have been developed however, not much attention has been given to the area of ontology usage analysis that shows how the developed ontologies are being used. Such a study is very important as we explain in this paper by using some motivational scenarios of a Semantic Web user in different roles. The discussion is followed by a summary of the state-of-the-art of the existing literature on ontology usage to highlight gaps in this area. We define Ontology Usage Analysis and discuss our proposed Ontology Usage Analysis Framework (OUSAF) to measure the usage of an ontology on the web from different perspectives. On a real-world collected dataset, the results obtained from OUSAF demonstrate the practical utilization of OUSAF in measuring ontology usage analysis.","2015-05-01","2023-09-27 01:06:44","2024-03-26 15:02:12","2023-09-27 01:06:44","34–47","","C","80","","Know.-Based Syst.","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACM Digital Library","","19 citations (Crossref) [2024-03-26]","","C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\W5HKTKQZ\Ashraf 等。 - 2015 - Ontology usage analysis in the ontology lifecycle.pdf","","未整理","Ontology; Ontology lifecycle; Ontology usage analysis framework; Semantic web; Usage analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the concepts are often described differently in various ontologies, which create problems for the ontology integration. In this paper, an approach of an ontology repository and a rule base is proposed to handle the various concepts descriptions. A new mapping process is proposed. The results of the mappings are ontology joints, which are ontologies composed of sets of assertions about the concepts validated in the original ontologies. Metadata are used for the description of ontology and ontology joints. A rule base of how to interpret the concepts by applying the metadata is created after the mappings. Ontologies and the ontology joints in the repository can be reused for further ontology integration.

However, most ontologies and terminologies do not have such a two-level structure. Therefore, we present a method, called semantic enrichment, which generates a two-level ontology from a given one-level terminology and an auxiliary two-level ontology. During semantic enrichment, concepts of the one-level terminology are assigned to semantic types, which are the building blocks of the upper level of the auxiliary two-level ontology. The result of this process is the desired new two-level ontology. We discuss semantic enrichment of two example terminologies and how we approach the implementation of semantic enrichment in the medical domain.

Such a technique relies on a balanced co-existence of human intuition/creativity and technological support, referred to as Hybrid Intelligence. Additionally, it assumes collaborative modelling and collective/social intelligence. The method implies a certain degree of uncertainty that is, in principle, inversely proportional to the achieved consensus. There are two clear different convergence points between the proposed process and collective/social intelligence: (i) at a data level, because of the nature of the input which is generated by different individuals, communities, stakeholders and actors; and (ii) at a modelling level, where human and automatically generated inputs, design decisions and validations are expected to involve several contributors, experts, modellers or analysts.

Collision avoidance systems (CAS) are a key component in integrating a high number of UAS into the airspace in a safe way. This paper presents a distributed, autonomous, and knowledge-based CAS, called Dronetology System (DroS), for UASs. The CAS proposed here is managed using a novel ontology, called Dronetology-cas, which allows to make autonomous decisions according to the knowledge inferred from the data gathered by the UAS. DroS is deployed as part of the payload of the UAS. So, it is designed to run in an embedded platform with limited processing capacity and low battery consumption. DroS collects data from sensors and collaborative elements to make smart decisions using knowledge obtained from collaborative UASs, adapting the maneuvers of the aerial vehicles to their original flight plans, their kind of vehicle, and the collision scenario. DroS accountability involves recording its internal operation to assist with reconstructing the circumstances surrounding an autonomous maneuver or the details previous to a collision. DroS has been verified using the hardware in the loop (HIL) technique with a UAS traffic environment simulator.

In this paper, we present a global overview of these ideas, which have not been realized so far and could be interesting to the multimedia research community. We exemplify the complex information resources in terms of Gene Ontology (GO), Clinical Bioinformatics Ontology (CBO) and the Foundational Model of Anatomy (FMA). GO is a biomedical scientific research system used to describe genes and gene products, but no cellular components. CBO is a clinical oriented ontology of information, which potentially include many multimedia images: X-Ray, ultrasound and magnetic resonance images. FMA is a foundational clinical source used to describe the anatomy of the human body as well as cellular components. While scientists in each sector may use these systems to help develop their own information, it is very difficult for a layman or broad-spectrum researcher to integrate the two different languages into one interface.

A newly developed editor, which we propose in this paper, permits grammar definitions through CFG-LD (Context-Free Grammar with Lexical Dependency) that includes sequential and semantic structures of the grammars.

Formal methods allow system developers to design models of such systems. They provide constructs for modelling components and views of these systems. However, these formal methods do not include built-in constructs for modelling the environment, and more broadly, domain knowledge associated with system models. Although ontologies have demonstrated their efficiency in modelling domain-specific features, they are not available as built-in constructs in formal methods. This paper shows how formal ontologies can be used to model domain-specific knowledge, as well as how system models may refer to these ontologies through annotation. We rely on the Event-B refinement and proof state-based method, and the associated theories, to define a framework in which domain-specific knowledge ontologies are formalised as Event-B theories defining data types used to type Event-B system design models.

Therefore, HCI design is a core issue to the quality of such systems. HCI design often involves people with different backgrounds (e.g., Arts, Software Engineering, Design). This makes knowledge transfer a challenging issue due to the lack of a common conceptualization about HCI design, leading to semantic interoperability problems, such as ambiguity and imprecision when interpreting shared information. Ontologies have been acknowledged as a successful approach to represent domain knowledge and support knowledge-based solutions. Hence, in this work, we propose to explore the use of ontologies to represent structured knowledge of HCI design and improve knowledge sharing in this context. We developed the Human-Computer Interaction Design Ontology (HCIDO), which is part of the Human-Computer Interaction Ontology Network (HCI-ON) and is connected to the Software Engineering Ontology Network (SEON). By making knowledge related to the HCI design domain explicit and structured, HCIDO helped us to develop KTID, a tool that aims to support capturing and sharing knowledge to aid in HCI design by allowing HCI designers to annotate information about design choices in design artifacts shared with HCI design stakeholders. Preliminary results indicate that the tool can be particularly useful for novice HCI designers.","2023-01-27","2023-09-27 01:37:10","2024-03-26 15:02:04","2023-09-26","1–10","","","","","","","SBQS '22","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","ACM Digital Library","","0 citations (Crossref) [2024-03-26]","","","","知識本體; 人機互動; 已整理","Ontology; Knowledge Management; HCI Design; User Interface","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We compared the accuracy of this method to that of the MeSH-based method. We reviewed the 4,506 studies on Vivli.org categorized by our method. Condition terms of 4,501 (99.89%) studies were successfully mapped to SNOMED CT concepts, and with a minimum concept mapping score threshold, 4,428 (98.27%) studies were categorized into 31 predefined categories. When validating with manual categorization results on a random sample of 300 studies, our method achieved an estimated categorization accuracy of 95.7%, while the MeSH-based method had an accuracy of 85.0%.

However, building ontologies is not a trivial task. Ontology reuse can help in this matter. The search and selection of ontologies to be reused should consider the alignment between their scope and the scope of the ontology being developed. In this paper, we discuss how goal modeling can be helpful in this context and we propose GO-FOR, a framework in which goals are the central elements to promote ontology reuse. We introduce goal-oriented ontology patterns as a new type of pattern to be applied to develop ontologies in a goal-oriented approach. Results of the use of GO-FOR to build an ontology used to integrate water quality data are also shown in this paper.","2019-07","2023-09-28 08:51:39","2024-03-26 15:02:02","2023-09-28 08:51:39","99-106","","","","","","GO-FOR","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","4 citations (Crossref) [2024-03-26]","","C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\BZB9RJJV\8843481.html; C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\AZPS99SM\Reginato et al. - 2019 - GO-FOR A Goal-Oriented Framework for Ontology Reu.pdf","","知識本體; 本體建立","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2019 IEEE 20th International Conference on Information Reuse and Integration for Data Science (IRI)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nowadays, semi-automatic algorithms build connections among these datasets by exploring a variety of methods. Interconnected open data demands automatic methods and tools to maintain their consistency over time. The update of linked data is considered as key process due to the evolutionary characteristic of such structured datasets. However, data changing operations might inﬂuence well-formed links, which turns difﬁcult to maintain the consistencies of connections over time. In this article, we propose a thorough survey that provides a systematic review of the state of the art in link maintenance in linked open data evolution scenario. We conduct a detailed analysis of the literature for characterising and understanding methods and algorithms responsible for detecting, ﬁxing and updating links between RDF data.

These knowledge bases play important roles in enabling machines to understand texts. However, most current knowledge bases are in English and non-English knowledge bases, especially Chinese ones, are still very rare. Many previous systems that extract knowledge from online encyclopedias, although are applicable for building a Chinese knowledge base, still suffer from two challenges. The first is that it requires great human efforts to construct an ontology and build a supervised knowledge extraction model. The second is that the update frequency of knowledge bases is very slow. To solve these challenges, we propose a never-ending Chinese Knowledge extraction system, CN-DBpedia, which can automatically generate a knowledge base that is of ever-increasing in size and constantly updated. Specially, we reduce the human costs by reusing the ontology of existing knowledge bases and building an end-to-end facts extraction model. We further propose a smart active update strategy to keep the freshness of our knowledge base with little human costs. The 164 million API calls of the published services justify the success of our system.","2017","2023-09-28 09:35:00","2024-03-26 15:01:58","","428-438","","","","","","CN-DBpedia","Lecture Notes in Computer Science","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","120 citations (Crossref) [2024-03-26] titleTranslation: CN-DBpedia：永無止境的中文知識擷取系統 abstractTranslation:  人們付出了巨大的努力來從線上百科全書中獲取知識庫。這些知識庫在使機器理解文字方面發揮著重要作用。然而，目前的知識庫大多是英文的，非英文的知識庫，尤其是中文的知識庫還很少。以前的許多從線上百科全書中提取知識的系統雖然適用於建立中文知識庫，但仍面臨兩個挑戰。首先是建構本體、建立有監督的知識抽取模型需要付出龐大的人力。二是知識庫的更新頻率很慢。為了解決這些挑戰，我們提出了一個永無止境的中文知識抽取系統CN-DBpedia，它可以自動產生一個規模不斷增加並不斷更新的知識庫。特別是，我們透過重複使用現有知識庫的本體並建立端到端的事實提取模型來降低人力成本。我們進一步提出了一種智慧主動更新策略，以很少的人力成本來維持知識庫的新鮮度。已發布服務的 1.64 億次 API 呼叫證明了我們系統的成功。","","C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\58UZMKMS\Xu et al. - 2017 - CN-DBpedia A Never-Ending Chinese Knowledge Extra.pdf","","重要; 知識本體; 知識圖譜; 中文","Current Knowledge Base; Exist Knowledge Base; Human Cost; Knowledge Base; Natural Language Sentence","Salem Benferhat; Karim Tabia; Moonis Ali","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Some symbol structures might have the property of determining choice and the order of application of transformations to be applied on other symbol structures. These are essentially the programs. Programs when executed --- typically through the conventional process of compilation and interpretation and eventually --- when they operate on symbols that are linked through grounding to particular effectors --- produce behavior. Working memory holds symbol structures as they are being processed. Long-term memory, generally speaking, is the repository of programs and can be changed by addition, deletion, or modification of symbol structures that it holds. Such a system can compute any Turing-computable function provided it has sufficiently large memory and its primitive set of transformations are adequate for the composition of arbitrarily symbol structures (programs) and the interpreter is capable of interpreting any possible symbol structure. This also means that any particular set of symbolic processes can be carried out by an NANN --- provided it has potentially infinite memory, or finds a way to use its transducers and effectors to use the external physical environment to serve as its memory). 14 Chapter 12 Knowledge in SAI systems is typically embedded in complex symbol structures such as lists (Norvig, 1992), logical databases (Genesereth and Nilsson, 1987), semantic networks (Quillian, 1968), frames (Minsky, 1975), schemas (Arbib, 1972; 1994), and manipulated by (often serial) procedures or inferences (e.g., list processing, application of production rules (Waterman, 1985), or execution of logic programs (Kowalski, 1977) carried out by a central processor that accesse...","1995-07-06","2023-10-11 05:20:50","2024-03-26 15:01:56","","","","","","","","Symbolic Artificial Intelligence And Numeric Artificial Neural Networks","","","","","","","","","","","","ResearchGate","","10 citations (Crossref) [2024-03-26]","","C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\8QE2KBTP\Honavar - 1995 - Symbolic Artificial Intelligence And Numeric Artif.pdf; ","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2240301_Symbolic_Artificial_Intelligence_And_Numeric_Artificial_Neural_Networks_Towards_A_Resolution_Of_The_Dichotomy","經典","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Its popularity is clearly influenced by the introduction of Google's Knowledge Graph in 2012, and since then the term has been widely used without a definition. A large variety of interpretations has hampered the evolution of a common understanding of knowledge graphs. Numerous research papers refer to Google's Knowledge Graph, although no official documentation about the used methods exists. The prerequisite for widespread academic and commercial adoption of a concept or technology is a common understanding, based ideally on a definition that is free from ambiguity. We tackle this issue by discussing and defining the term knowledge graph, considering its history and diversity in interpretations and use. Our goal is to propose a definition of knowledge graphs that serves as basis for discussions on this topic and contributes to a common vision.","2016-09-01","2023-08-11 08:21:59","2023-11-23 09:23:43","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ResearchGate","","","","C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\2QIG8UAY\Ehrlinger and Wöß - 2016 - Towards a Definition of Knowledge Graphs.pdf; ","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323316736_Towards_a_Definition_of_Knowledge_Graphs","知識圖譜; 已整理; 經典","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These graphs represent biomedical concepts and relationships in the form of nodes and edges. In this review, we discuss how these graphs are constructed and applied with a particular focus on how machine learning approaches are changing these processes. Biomedical knowledge graphs have often been constructed by integrating databases that were populated by experts via manual curation, but we are now seeing a more robust use of automated systems. A number of techniques are used to represent knowledge graphs, but often machine learning methods are used to construct a low-dimensional representation that can support many different applications. This representation is designed to preserve a knowledge graph’s local and/or global structure. Additional machine learning methods can be applied to this representation to make predictions within genomic, pharmaceutical, and clinical domains. We frame our discussion first around knowledge graph construction and then around unifying representational learning techniques and unifying applications. Advances in machine learning for biomedicine are creating new opportunities across many domains, and we note potential avenues for future work with knowledge graphs that appear particularly promising.","2020-01-01","2023-10-11 05:12:43","2024-03-26 15:01:57","2023-10-11 05:12:43","1414-1428","","","18","","Computational and Structural Biotechnology Journal","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","128 citations (Crossref) [2024-03-26]","","C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\47A7XTCC\Nicholson and Greene - 2020 - Constructing knowledge graphs and their biomedical.pdf; C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\2E3XIDMN\S2001037020302804.html","","機器學習; 知識圖譜; 已讀; 已整理; 醫學; 本體建立","Natural language processing; Machine learning; knowledge graphs; Text mining; Lterature review; Network embeddings","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Results showed that (1) compared to the synchronous mode, students' collaborative notes quality is better in the asynchronous learning mode, and students could achieve higher learning gains; (2) students with low prior knowledge levels are more productive in producing high-quality notes and receive more significant learning gain from them. These findings suggested that teachers can adapt collaborative notes in online asynchronous learning of introductory courses to enhance students' learning outcomes.","2023-04","2023-10-12 05:42:19","2024-03-26 15:01:54","2023-10-12 05:42:19","159-164","","","","","","Does Taking Collaborative Notes Really Help?","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","0 citations (Crossref) [2024-03-26]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2023 5th International Conference on Computer Science and Technologies in Education (CSTE)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Clinical note authors too commonly adopt their own note-taking structures and styles, limiting the applicability of rule-based and statistical models. While the context of any given sentence within a note carries important implied information, context is notoriously difficult for a language model to infer. However, recent advances in deep learning NLP methods such as pre-training on domain-specific corpora, novel embedding structures, and transformer architectures have enabled an awareness of context not previously attainable. In this work, I study the application of these evidenced NLP approaches to a gold standard annotated corpus of primary care notes of multiple Mayo Clinic EHR systems. The strongly labelled data will be supplemented with large volumes of weakly labelled data curated using distant supervision. The combined dataset will be used to train and evaluate context classification and section boundary detection models that classify the current context of a sentence given adjacent text segments. Once validated against primary care corpora, transfer learning methods will enable access to shared knowledge across more specific clinical domains, enabling generalizability across clinical domains and a degree of transparency into the shared aspects of the integrated model.","2022-06","2023-10-12 05:42:36","2024-03-26 15:01:53","2023-10-12 05:42:36","479-480","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","0 citations (Crossref) [2024-03-26] ISSN: 2575-2634","","C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\7H57DTR5\9874473.html","","機器學習; 病歷分析; 醫學","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022 IEEE 10th International Conference on Healthcare Informatics (ICHI)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Knowledge is central to strategy and operations in most engineering organizations and digital technologies have been employed in attempts to improve current knowledge management practices. A systematic literature review was undertaken to address the question: how do digital technologies influence knowledge management in the engineering sector? Twenty-seven primary studies were identified from 3097 papers on these topics within the engineering literature published between 2010 and 2022. Four knowledge management processes supported by digital technologies were recognized: knowledge creation, storage and retrieval, sharing and application. In supporting knowledge management, digital technologies were found to have been acting in five roles: repositories, transactive memory systems, communication spaces, boundary objects and non-human actors. However, the ability of digital technologies to perform these roles simultaneously had not been considered and similarly knowledge management had not been addressed as a holistic process. Hence, it was concluded that a holistic approach to knowledge management combined with the deployment of digital technologies in multiple roles simultaneously would likely yield significant competitive advantage and organizational value for organizations in the engineering sector.","2023","2023-10-12 05:44:10","2024-03-26 15:01:53","2023-10-12 05:44:10","1-15","","","","","","The Influence of Digital Technologies on Knowledge Management in Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","1 citations (Crossref) [2024-03-26] Conference Name: IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","","D:\Paper\Yao et al. - 2023 - The Influence of Digital Technologies on Knowledge.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We evaluate quEHRy on 2 clinical question answering (QA) datasets. We evaluate each component separately as well as holistically to gain deeper insights. We also conduct a thorough error analysis for a crucial subcomponent, medical concept normalization.Using gold concepts, the precision of quEHRy is 98.33% and 90.91% for the 2 datasets, while the overall accuracy was 97.41% and 87.75%. Precision was 94.03% and 87.79% even after employing an automated medical concept extraction system (MetaMap). Most incorrectly predicted medical concepts were broader in nature than gold-annotated concepts (representative of the ones present in EHRs), eg, Diabetes versus Diabetes Mellitus, Non-Insulin-Dependent.The primary performance barrier to deployment of the system is due to errors in medical concept extraction (a component not studied in this article), which affects the downstream generation of correct logical structures. This indicates the need to build QA-specific clinical concept normalizers that understand EHR context to extract the “relevant” medical concepts from questions.We present an end-to-end QA system that allows information access from EHRs using natural language and returns an exact, verifiable answer.

In this survey, we review recent advances in KBQA with the focus on solving complex questions, which usually contain multiple subjects, express compound relations, or involve numerical operations. In detail, we begin with introducing the complex KBQA task and relevant background. Then, we present two mainstream categories of methods for complex KBQA, namely semantic parsing-based (SP-based) methods and information retrieval-based (IR-based) methods. Specifically, we illustrate their procedures with flow designs and discuss their difference and similarity. Next, we summarize the challenges that these two categories of methods encounter when answering complex questions, and explicate advanced solutions as well as techniques used in existing work. After that, we discuss the potential impact of pre-trained language models (PLMs) on complex KBQA.

The purpose of the developed ontology model is to define relations between learning objects that can be applied for their effective search and visualization. As the number of learning objects increases, the representation of the knowledge domain becomes challenging. In this paper, the authors propose the application of multidimensional concept maps (MCMs) for domain knowledge representation. The definition of different attributes used in the ontology model allow for defining the different dimensions needed for MCM ontology visualization. In order to achieve integration of the defined ontology model and MCMs, a software tool named Ontology-based system for learning objects retrieval (OBSLO) was developed. OBSLO’s role is to dynamically generate MCMs given the defined ontology with its relations and attributes, while also providing a content delivery environment and working space for learners. Proposed OBSLO architecture with integrated ontology model and MCMs was evaluated and compared to the learning management system where ontology and MCMs were not used. It was shown that learners using OBSLO showed better success rate in learning and positive level of satisfaction.","2023-09-01","2023-10-18 11:30:00","2024-03-26 15:01:31","2023-10-18 11:30:00","1043-1054","","5","24","","","","","","","","","","en-US","Copyright (c) 2023 Journal of Internet Technology","","","","jit.ndhu.edu.tw","","0 citations (Crossref) [2024-03-26] Number: 5 titleTranslation: 用于个性化学习的学习对象本体模型的多维概念图表示法 abstractTranslation:  本作品介绍了用于学习对象领域知识的本体模型的创建和表示。开发本体模型的目的是定义学习对象之间的关系，以便有效地搜索和可视化学习对象。随着学习对象数量的增加，知识领域的表征变得具有挑战性。在本文中，作者提出了应用多维概念图（MCM）来表示领域知识的方法。通过定义本体模型中使用的不同属性，可以定义 MCM 本体可视化所需的不同维度。为了实现已定义的本体模型与多维本体图的整合，开发了一个名为 ""基于本体的学习对象检索系统（OBSLO）""的软件工具。OBSLO 的作用是根据已定义的本体及其关系和属性动态生成多 媒体内容，同时为学习者提供内容交付环境和工作空间。对拟议的集成了本体模型和多模块内容的 OBSLO 架构进行了评估，并与未使用本体和多模块内容的学习管理系统进行了比较。结果表明，使用 OBSLO 的学习者学习成功率更高，满意度也更高。","","C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\MIZ4HDCK\Jović et al. - 2023 - Multidimensional Concept Map Representation of the.pdf","","知識本體; 人機互動; 使用者研究","Ontology; Learning objects; Multidimensional concept maps; Personalized e-learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The introduction of the deadly coronavirus has forced this transformation to pickup its pace. These unprecedented times have forced all daily activities to be carried out maintaining a social distance and everything from shopping to studying is being preferred to be done online, which has given a surge to new and effective educational technologies. While many studies are actively working on linear and collaborative learning in a virtual learning environment, few have tried to exploit the use of Embodied Conversational Agent (ECA) for personalized tutoring. This thesis research develops a novel approach that is able to not only allow ECA to perform the role of human tutors but also interact with users in an adaptive manner, according to their level of knowledge. This approach extends the research previously accomplished by our research group that uses self-adjusted POMDP policies to guide the interaction between ECA and users. Furthermore, the construction of a generic, scalable tutoring ontology enables the dialogue management of ECA to track the history of belief states and use the trend of changes to estimate the level of user’s knowledge for the control of feedback and the tasks presented to the user. It is anticipated that the research work helps improving online learning with the ECA acting as a personal tutor.","2022","2023-10-18 11:07:19","2023-11-23 09:22:35","2023-10-18 11:07:19","","87","","","","","","","","","","University of Windsor (Canada)","Canada -- Ontario, CA","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","M.Sc.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9798438731856 Publication Title: ProQuest Dissertations and Theses titleTranslation: 使用嵌入式对话代理进行个性化辅导的方法 abstractTranslation:  自互联网出现以来，世界一直在慢慢地、稳步地实现数字化。致命冠状病毒的出现迫使这一转变加快了步伐。这个史无前例的时代迫使所有日常活动都要保持一定的社交距离，从购物到学习，人们都喜欢在网上完成，这也催生了新的、有效的教育技术。虽然许多研究都在积极研究虚拟学习环境中的线性学习和协作学习，但很少有人尝试利用嵌入式对话代理（ECA）进行个性化辅导。本论文研究开发了一种新方法，不仅能让 ECA 扮演人类辅导员的角色，还能根据用户的知识水平，以自适应的方式与用户互动。这种方法扩展了我们研究小组之前完成的研究，即使用自我调整的 POMDP 策略来指导 ECA 与用户之间的互动。此外，通过构建一个通用的、可扩展的辅导本体，ECA 的对话管理可以跟踪信念状态的历史，并利用变化趋势来估计用户的知识水平，从而控制反馈和向用户提出的任务。预计这项研究工作将有助于改善由 ECA 充当个人导师的在线学习。","","C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\F9YFP4HN\Vyas - 2022 - An Approach of Using Embodied Conversational Agent.pdf","","已整理","Embodied conversational agent; Tutoring ontology; Virtual reality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Several methodologies exploiting numerous techniques of various fields (machine learning, text mining, knowledge representation and reasoning, information retrieval and natural language processing) are being proposed to bring some level of automation in the process of ontology acquisition from unstructured text. This paper describes the process of ontology learning and further classification of ontology learning techniques into three classes (linguistics, statistical and logical) and discusses many algorithms under each category.

This is particularly the case during formal design reviews at any point during a product's life-cycle where engineering changes are not fully documented or where salient but important aspects of decision making are difficult to document explicitly. Though many software systems are available to support design reviews, they have not necessarily met the expectations of industry. Consequently, traditional knowledge capture methods tend to be time-consuming, costly and disruptive leading to many companies simply giving up on this crucial aspect of product development. This paper presents research carried out with regard to prototyping and testing a potential knowledge engineering capture and reuse solution, demonstrating real-time user-logging using virtual design environments focused on team-based design 'reviews'. Called the Virtual Aided Design Engineering Review (VADER) system, it provides millisecond precision time-phased knowledge capture in an automatic and unobtrusive manner. Both structured and unstructured data are synthesised via a ubiquitous integration and temporal synchronisation (UbiITS) framework that enables interactive information mapping, retrieval and mining. VADER's frontend includes a virtual reality based 3D model view display as a multiuser collaborative interface and an auxiliary web interface for concurrent access by multiple distributed users during product design discussions. Feedback from engineers using the system demonstrated that this concept is one which believe would substantially enhance their engineering task knowledge capture, rapid retrieval and reuse capability. It was also surmised that, if required, such a system can be extended throughout the whole product development process capturing individual and team-based engineers' inputs across the whole cradle-to-grave product life cycle. Also, due to its generic nature, this approach is not limited only to engineering applications or virtual environments but can potentially be used in other sectors using computer-based technologies of any kind.","2017","2023-10-16 04:59:54","2024-05-23 08:45:20","2023-10-16 04:59:54","681-708","","10-12","28","","J.

The capture, management and sharing of employee knowledge is seen as vital if the industry is to remain highly innovative and retain its pre-eminent position internationally. Aerospace manufacturers, such as BAE Systems, often have to re-engineer business processes routinely to ensure their survival. Knowledge sharing in the industry is seen as challenging due to the dispersed nature of its operations and multi-tier supply chains. This article, through a 5-year participant-observation study at the World's second largest aerospace and defence organisation, BAE Systems, proposes a new paradigm for virtual knowledge sharing in dispersed aerospace product development based on emergent social software platforms such as Enterprise 2.0 technologies. The developed framework and methodologies are applied to the bespoke BAE Systems' engineering lifecycle process to validate its effectiveness with results indicating that Enterprise 2.0 technologies offer a more openly innovative environment in which employees may share and interact with knowledge more effectively and easily across geographical and functional boundaries, compared with conventional engineering information systems.","2018-11","2023-10-16 03:53:00","2024-03-26 15:01:40","2023-10-16 03:52:59","2297-2308","","13","232","","Proc.

A review of literature and research has established that small-and medium-sized businesses are rich in tacit knowledge, an essential piece of the knowledge creation and conversion process that supports organizational learning and knowledge—a factor in attaining and sustaining competitive advantage. Small- and medium sized businesses are inherently well-suited to informal learning, a collaborative function of sharing knowledge through conversations, dialogue, etc. However, this informal exchange may or may not naturally occur in SMBs. A more structured approach to the process that fosters informal knowledge sharing is needed to ensure knowledge creation occurs within the organization. Traditional attempts at KM and e-learning, which focused on knowledge as a static object rather than a dynamic process were unsuccessful in helping SMBs achieve competitive advantage. There is growing body of research that advocates for the integration of KM and e-learning to address past short-comings of each and create an environment that supports knowledge creation, sharing and dissemination. A framework to align the knowledge creation process and e-learning web tools was proposed to encourage knowledge sharing and build a learning organization to establish sustainable competitive advantage.","2014","2023-10-13 06:53:18","2023-11-23 09:22:41","","","","","","","","","","","","","ProQuest Dissertations Publishing","","eng","","","","","ccu.primo.exlibrisgroup.com","","Book Title: Integrating Knowledge Management and E-Learning to Enhance Knowledge Creation and Conversion for Competitive Advantage in Small- and Medium-Sized Businesses ISBN: 9781303981746 abstractTranslation:  全球商業經濟已將知識確立為組織最重要的資產和競爭優勢的主要因素。對文獻和研究的回顧表明，中小型企業擁有豐富的隱性知識，這是支持組織學習和知識的知識創造和轉換過程的重要組成部分，也是獲得和維持競爭優勢的因素。中小型企業本質上非常適合非正式學習，即透過對話、對話等共享知識的協作功能。然而，這種非正式交流可能會也可能不會自然地發生在中小企業中。需要一種更結構化的方法來促進非正式知識共享，以確保組織內部發生知識創造。傳統的知識管理和電子學習嘗試將知識視為靜態物件而不是動態過程，但未能成功幫助中小企業獲得競爭優勢。越來越多的研究主張將知識管理和電子學習結合，以解決兩者過去的缺點，並創造一個支持知識創造、分享和傳播的環境。提出了一個協調知識創造過程和電子學習網路工具的框架，以鼓勵知識共享並建立學習型組織以建立可持續的競爭優勢。 titleTranslation: 整合知識管理和電子學習，加強知識創造與轉化，提升中小型企業的競爭優勢","","","","重要; 待讀; 應用; 知識系統; 已整理","Communication; Ontology; Collaboration; Taxonomy; Knowledge acquisition; Knowledge management; Architecture; Business education; Competitive advantage; Core competencies; Culture; Efficiency; Employees; Explicit knowledge; Information Technology; Innovations; Knowledge sharing; Learning; Literature reviews; Management; Online instruction; Organizational learning; Socialization; Success; Tacit knowledge; Turnover","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We developed an open biomedical knowledge graph–based system termed Reasoning Over Biomedical Objects linked in Knowledge Oriented Pathways (ROBOKOP). ROBOKOP consists of both a front-end user interface and a back-end knowledge graph. The ROBOKOP user interface allows users to posit questions and explore answer subgraphs. Users can also posit questions through direct Cypher query of the underlying knowledge graph, which currently contains roughly 6 million nodes or biomedical entities and 140 million edges or predicates describing the relationship between nodes, drawn from over 30 curated data sources.                                         Objective               We aimed to apply ROBOKOP to survey data on workplace exposures and immune-mediated diseases from the Environmental Polymorphisms Registry (EPR) within the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences.                                         Methods               We analyzed EPR survey data and identified 45 associations between workplace chemical exposures and immune-mediated diseases, as self-reported by study participants (n= 4574), with 20 associations significant at P<.05 after false discovery rate correction. We then used ROBOKOP to (1) validate the associations by determining whether plausible connections exist within the ROBOKOP knowledge graph and (2) propose biological mechanisms that might explain them and serve as hypotheses for subsequent testing. We highlight the following three exemplar associations: carbon monoxide-multiple sclerosis, ammonia-asthma, and isopropanol-allergic disease.                                         Results               ROBOKOP successfully returned answer sets for three queries that were posed in the context of the driving examples.

These lack real pressure from outside stakeholders because technological solutions are often agreed on based on a curriculum, and implemented features can be negotiated based on the students’ skills and the course schedule. Therefore, typical industry–education cooperation SE projects hardly resemble the real SE projects carried out in software companies. To overcome these limitations, we developed and tested a university–industry model where real-life development pressure coming from real customers and a software provider was generated to suit educational purposes.

Today, businesses operating in a digital environment require increased supply-chain automation, interoperability, and data governance. While research on the semantic web and interoperability has recently received much attention, a dearth of studies investigates the relationship between these two concepts in depth. To address this knowledge gap, the objective of this study is to conduct a review and bibliometric analysis of 3511 Scopus-registered papers on the semantic web and interoperability published over the past two decades. In addition, the publications were analyzed using a variety of bibliometric indicators, such as publication year, journal, authors, countries, and institutions. Keyword co-occurrence and co-citation networks were utilized to identify the primary research hotspots and group the relevant literature. The findings of the review and bibliometric analysis indicate the dominance of conference papers as a means of disseminating knowledge and the substantial contribution of developed nations to the semantic web field. In addition, the keyword co-occurrence network analysis reveals a significant emphasis on semantic web languages, sensors and computing, graphs and models, and linking and integration techniques. Based on the co-citation clustering, the Internet of Things, semantic web services, ontology mapping, building information modeling, bioinformatics, education and e-learning, and semantic web languages were identified as the primary themes contributing to the flow of knowledge and the growth of the semantic web and interoperability field. Overall, this review substantially contributes to the literature and increases scholars’ and practitioners’ awareness of the current knowledge composition and future research directions of the semantic web field.","2022","2023-10-13 06:56:04","2024-03-26 15:01:48","","161-","","6","14","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","ccu.primo.exlibrisgroup.com","","7 citations (Crossref) [2024-03-26] Place: Basel Publisher: MDPI AG titleTranslation: 繪製語意網和互通性的過去、現在和未來研究 abstractTranslation:  對等系統的巨大進步和開發語義網路的嘗試揭示了跨多個領域的資訊系統的一個關鍵問題：缺乏語義互通性。如今，在數位環境中營運的企業需要提高供應鏈自動化、互通性和資料治理。雖然語義網和互通性的研究最近受到了廣泛關注，但缺乏深入研究這兩個概念之間關係的研究。為了解決這一知識差距，本研究的目的是對過去 20 年來發表的 3511 篇 Scopus 註冊論文進行回顧和文獻計量分析，內容涉及語義網和互通性。此外，還使用各種文獻計量指標對出版物進行了分析，例如出版年份、期刊、作者、國家和機構。利用關鍵字共現和共引網絡來確定主要研究熱點並對相關文獻進行分組。審查和文獻計量分析的結果表明會議論文作為知識傳播手段的主導地位以及已開發國家對語義網路領域的重大貢獻。此外，關鍵字共現網路分析揭示了對語義網路語言、感測器和計算、圖形和模型以及連結和整合技術的重視。基於同被引聚類，物聯網、語義網路服務、本體映射、建築資訊模型、生物資訊學、教育和電子學習以及語義網路語言被確定為有助於知識流動和知識流動的主要主題。語義網和互通性領域的發展。總體而言，這篇綜述對文獻做出了重大貢獻，並提高了學者和實務工作者對語義網路領域當前知識構成和未來研究方向的認識。","","C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\BPSYYFBF\Rejeb et al. - 2022 - Charting Past, Present, and Future Research in the.pdf","","待讀; Survey; 已整理; 語意網","Ontology; Semantics; Bioinformatics; Knowledge; Collaboration; Data mining; Software; Semantic web; Bibliometrics; Blockchain; Building management systems; Cloud computing; Clustering; Distance learning; Fault diagnosis; Fuzzy logic; Information systems; Internet of Things; Interoperability; Languages; Network analysis; semantic web services; Supply chains; Technology; Web services; World Wide Web","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The academic writing skill-set displayed by CS and EE bachelor students was gauged by interpretative content analysis of a corpus of full-text theses, retrieved from a university repository. Two research questions were addressed: 1) what are the citation practices, employed by two cohorts of final year bachelor students, in electrical engineering and computer science? 2) what use of academic writing genre conventions can be quantified through interpretative content analysis? The intention of the study was to categorize the purposes behind citation use in bachelor level theses. Both student cohorts displayed an exaggerated use of citations, deviating from fully mature academic writing practices in the CS and EE fields. Many factual statements of a general nature were supported by multiple and weakly motivated instances of citations to a limited set of sources. An apparent genre convention was to cite sources mainly in text segments of introductory or survey character. Hence the investigated bachelor level theses made little use of citations to support the choice of research question, method or in critical discussion of results.","2022-02","2023-10-13 07:19:27","2024-03-26 15:01:42","2023-10-13 07:19:27","65-70","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","0 citations (Crossref) [2024-03-26] ISSN: 2470-6698","","C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\2UE9VIF7\Malm and Hamrin - 2022 - Citation Practices in Final Year Computer Science .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022 IEEE International Conference on Teaching, Assessment and Learning for Engineering (TALE)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In particular, there is a lack of such knowledge for engineering education programs. In this paper we present results from a survey where we asked 23 students from three different Swedish universities about which generic skills are needed and developed in a Master thesis project in Software Engineering.

Based on 995 publications, Jones (2013) identified four main problems in PhD thesis production; attrition, supervisor relationship, supervisor quality, social isolation. These issues also apply to theses at bachelor and master level In theses applied research methods are used in order to solve a problem. Theses end an education level and constitute a bridge into work or further studies and even an academic career. This core activity at universities requires a lot of resources and is very time consuming. The thesis quality varies and topic relevance to societal needs is often weak. Another problem is the high dropout and inefficient administrative procedures. Furthermore the digital resources for autonomous learning of research methods aren't optimally provided The European Union's approximately 4000 Higher Education Institutions and about 20 million students need better support in this area The demand for better mass scale support systems in higher education is also a global need with 1200 Higher Education Institutions worldwide (listed by ARWU). The number of higher education students is about 178 million (2010) and are forecasted to increase to 262 million by 2025. The online IT-support system, SciPro (Supporting the Scientific Process), has been developed during five years at the Department of Computer and Systems Sciences, Stockholm University. During the period 2012-2013 706 bachelor and master theses was managed through the SciPro system In 2014 91 PhD students are included as well This study summaries the experience and results during five years, including and going beyond our previous studies (17 publications). The focus of the SciPro project is technical implementation of pedagogical processes leading to quality learning and quality theses. The SciPro online system is modular and unique, consisting of: 1) Idea bank; with students, supervisors and business organisation's thesis topic ideas, 2) Matching; students paired with supervisors based on ideas and research area, 3) Objective (Milestones) and subjective (Project state) progress indicators, 4) Meta-supervision; instructions and cues for all students and supervisors, 5) Realtime statistics; for monitoring, quality assurance and evaluation, 6) Communication module; forum, notifications, shared files, checklists, 7) Peer Portal; peer review process and peer interaction 8) Multimedia resources for autonomous learning of research methods, and 9) Anti-plagiarism control; integrated and automatic The SciPro system works on all devices connected to Internet. It significantly reduces administration of all thesis related tasks for all involved SciPro can manage theses at a whole University fulfilling administrators', supervisors' and student's needs. With minor adaptations and development SciPro can be useful at most universities. The presentation will include live demonstrations and evaluations from all stakeholders' points of view.","2014-10","2023-10-13 07:12:48","2024-03-26 15:01:45","2023-10-13 07:12:48","1-1","","","","","","How to produce quality theses at universities in a large scale","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","4 citations (Crossref) [2024-03-26] ISSN: 2377-634X","","C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\KNM5SNNI\Hansson - 2014 - How to produce quality theses at universities in a.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2014 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE) Proceedings","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The purpose of this work is to automatically populate an ontology using deep neural networks for updating an ontology with new facts from an input knowledge resource. In this study for automatic ontology population, a bi-LSTM-based term extraction model based on character embedding is proposed to extract the terms from a sentence. The extracted terms are regarded as the concepts of the ontology. Then, a multi-layer perception network is employed to decide the predicates between the pairs of the extracted concepts. The two concepts (one serves as subject and the other as object) along with the predicate form a triple. The number of occurrences of the dependency relations between the concepts and the predicates are estimated. The predicates with low occurrence frequency are filtered out to obtain precise triples for ontology population. For evaluation of the proposed method, we collected 46,646 sentences from Ontonotes 5.0 for training and testing the bi-LSTM-based term extraction model. We also collected 404,951 triples from ConceptNet 5 for training and testing the multilayer perceptron-based triple extraction model.

Consequently, so many medical errors can happen and even kill people. Likewise, there is such an important field that can handle this problem, which is the information extraction. There are several important tasks in this field to extract the important and desired information from unstructured text written in natural language. The main principal tasks are named entity recognition and relation extraction since they can structure the text by extracting the relevant information.

In the medical field, any judgment or decision is fraught with risk. A doctor will carefully judge whether a patient is sick before forming a reasonable explanation based on the patient’s symptoms and/or an examination. Therefore, to be a viable and accepted tool, AI needs to mimic human judgment and interpretation skills. Specifically, explainable AI (XAI) aims to explain the information behind the black-box model of deep learning that reveals how the decisions are made. This paper provides a survey of the most recent XAI techniques used in healthcare and related medical imaging applications. We summarize and categorize the XAI types, and highlight the algorithms used to increase interpretability in medical imaging topics. In addition, we focus on the challenging XAI problems in medical applications and provide guidelines to develop better interpretations of deep learning models using XAI concepts in medical image and text analysis. Furthermore, this survey provides future directions to guide developers and researchers for future prospective investigations on clinical topics, particularly on applications with medical imaging.","2023-01","2023-10-25 07:30:21","2024-03-26 15:00:54","2023-10-25 07:30:21","634","","2","23","","","","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","www.mdpi.com","","77 citations (Crossref) [2024-03-26] Number: 2 Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute titleTranslation: 醫療保健中可解釋的人工智慧技術調查","","C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\X2Z2VQF7\Chaddad et al. - 2023 - Survey of Explainable AI Techniques in Healthcare.pdf","","機器學習; 已整理; 可解釋性; 醫療","deep learning; explainable AI; medical imaging; radiomics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This advancement has led to more fluent and coherent NLG, leading to improved development in downstream tasks such as abstractive summarization, dialogue generation, and data-to-text generation. However, it is also apparent that deep learning based generation is prone to hallucinate unintended text, which degrades the system performance and fails to meet user expectations in many real-world scenarios. To address this issue, many studies have been presented in measuring and mitigating hallucinated texts, but these have never been reviewed in a comprehensive manner before. In this survey, we thus provide a broad overview of the research progress and challenges in the hallucination problem in NLG. The survey is organized into two parts: (1) a general overview of metrics, mitigation methods, and future directions, and (2) an overview of task-specific research progress on hallucinations in the following downstream tasks, namely abstractive summarization, dialogue generation, generative question answering, data-to-text generation, and machine translation.

Usually, it is essential to understand the reasoning behind an AI model’s decision-making. Thus, the need for eXplainable AI (XAI) methods for improving trust in AI models has arisen. XAI has become a popular research subject within the AI field in recent years. Existing survey papers have tackled the concepts of XAI, its general terms, and post-hoc explainability methods but there have not been any reviews that have looked at the assessment methods, available tools, XAI datasets, and other related aspects. Therefore, in this comprehensive study, we provide readers with an overview of the current research and trends in this rapidly emerging area with a case study example. The study starts by explaining the background of XAI, common definitions, and summarizing recently proposed techniques in XAI for supervised machine learning. The review divides XAI techniques into four axes using a hierarchical categorization system: (i) data explainability, (ii) model explainability, (iii) post-hoc explainability, and (iv) assessment of explanations. We also introduce available evaluation metrics as well as open-source packages and datasets with future research directions. Then, the significance of explainability in terms of legal demands, user viewpoints, and application orientation is outlined, termed as XAI concerns. This paper advocates for tailoring explanation content to specific user types. An examination of XAI techniques and evaluation was conducted by looking at 410 critical articles, published between January 2016 and October 2022, in reputed journals and using a wide range of research databases as a source of information. The article is aimed at XAI researchers who are interested in making their AI models more trustworthy, as well as towards researchers from other disciplines who are looking for effective XAI methods to complete tasks with confidence while communicating meaning from data.","2023-11-01","2023-10-25 07:26:48","2024-04-26 09:22:59","2023-10-25 07:26:48","101805","","","99","","Information Fusion","Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","84 citations (Crossref) [2024-03-26] titleTranslation: 可解釋的人工智慧（XAI）：我們所知道的以及要實現可信賴的人工智慧還需要做什麼 abstractTranslation:  人工智慧 (AI) 目前被廣泛應用於各種複雜的應用中，但許多人工智慧模型的結果由於其黑盒性質而難以理解和信任。通常，了解人工智慧模型決策背後的推理至關重要。因此，需要可解釋的人工智慧（XAI）方法來提高對人工智慧模型的信任。近年來，XAI已成為人工智慧領域的熱門研究主題。現有的調查論文已經討論了 XAI 的概念、其一般術語和事後可解釋性方法，但還沒有任何評論關注評估方法、可用工具、XAI 數據集和其他相關方面。因此，在這項綜合研究中，我們透過案例研究範例為讀者提供了這個快速新興領域的當前研究和趨勢的概述。研究首先解釋 XAI 的背景、常見定義，並總結最近提出的監督機器學習的 XAI 技術。本綜述使用分層分類系統將 XAI 技術分為四個軸：（i）資料可解釋性，（ii）模型可解釋性，（iii）事後可解釋性，以及（iv）解釋評估。我們還介紹了可用的評估指標以及具有未來研究方向的開源套件和資料集。然後，概述了可解釋性在法律要求、使用者觀點和應用方向方面的重要性，稱為 XAI 關注點。本文主張針對特定使用者類型客製化解釋內容。透過查看 2016 年 1 月至 2022 年 10 月期間在知名期刊上發表的 410 篇批評文章，並使用廣泛的研究資料庫作為資訊來源，對 XAI 技術和評估進行了檢查。本文針對的是那些有興趣讓自己的 AI 模型更值得信賴的 XAI 研究人員，以及來自其他學科的研究人員，他們正在尋找有效的 XAI 方法來自信地完成任務，同時傳達數據的含義。","","C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\6R2TPUJP\Sajid Ali 等。 - 2023 - Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) What we.pdf; C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\V54WUF6C\S1566253523001148.html","","已整理; 可解釋性","Deep Learning; AI principles; Data Fusion; Explainable Artificial Intelligence; Interpretable machine learning; Post-hoc explainability; Trustworthy AI; XAI assessment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using these components, Plumber dynamically generates suitable knowledge extraction pipelines and offers overall 432 distinct pipelines. We study the optimization problem of choosing optimal pipelines based on input sentences. To do so, we train a transformer-based classification model that extracts contextual embeddings from the input and finds an appropriate pipeline. We study the efficacy of Plumber for extracting the KG triples using standard datasets over three KGs: DBpedia, Wikidata, and Open Research Knowledge Graph. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of Plumber in dynamically generating KG completion pipelines, outperforming all baselines agnostic of the underlying KG.

During lectures, the lecturer wears a microphone, while the students can follow the lecture by using the ON system. After the lecture, the professor can edit and update the transcripts and translations, and students have the option to listen to the lecture and read the materials. We have conducted a series of one-time tests and currently, we are in the middle of two whole-semester pilot tests at the University of Ljubljana. In the tests, a speech recognition accuracy of up to 87.4% was achieved. Preliminary results have shown that the tool is especially useful for students who either do not understand the language of the course or understand it to a limited extent.

While many organizations, even large ones, still hire employees to perform these tasks, there is no doubt that the results are exposed to human error. Documenting meetings’ minutes is essential for its success and keeping track of the work progress and decisions flow, approvals, while keeping it complete, consistent, and coherent. This project idea was proposed by Aramco to develop a suitable solution for a hectic problem. The process of documenting and taking minutes can be tedious, so we aim to automate audio meeting transcription with the use of technologies that convert speech to text while recognizing the speaker and then process and analyze the most valuable information tagged based on persons in the meeting. This goal can be accomplished through the development of an app that uses speech recognition for conversion, voice recognition for identification of speakers, and natural language processing (NLP) for analysis and then combines them all in a transcription form with considerable accuracy. Further, the proposed system identifies potential events, deadlines, and follow-ups and adds them to the speaker’s calendar upon approval. In the future, we aspire to expand it with some features such as increasing the number of meeting members, creating special sections for each department in the company which adopt WeScribe, and feed our NLP model with more data to develop its performance and increase its accuracy.","2023","2023-10-25 06:45:39","2024-03-26 15:01:02","","755-766","","","","","","WeScribe","Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems","","","","Springer Nature","Singapore","en","","","","","Springer Link","","1 citations (Crossref) [2024-03-26] titleTranslation: WeScribe：智慧會議轉錄器和分析器應用程序 abstractTranslation:  在所有現有組織中，無論其類型或規模如何，都會定期舉行會議，邀請討論組織決策。儘管許多組織，甚至是大型組織，仍然僱用員工來執行這些任務，但毫無疑問，結果會受到人為錯誤的影響。記錄會議記錄對於會議的成功至關重要，並追蹤工作進度、決策流程、批准情況，同時保持會議的完整、一致和連貫性。這個專案想法是由阿美石油公司提出的，旨在為繁忙的問題開發合適的解決方案。記錄和記錄會議記錄的過程可能很乏味，因此我們的目標是使用技術將音頻會議轉錄自動化，在識別發言者的同時將語音轉換為文本，然後處理和分析根據會議人員標記的最有價值的信息。這一目標可以透過開發應用程式來實現，該應用程式使用語音識別進行轉換，使用語音識別來識別說話者，使用自然語言處理(NLP) 進行分析，然後將它們以相當準確的轉錄形式組合起來。此外，建議的系統會識別潛在的事件、截止日期和後續行動，並在批准後將其添加到演講者的日曆中。未來，我們希望透過一些功能來擴展它，例如增加會議成員的數量，為採用 WeScribe 的公司每個部門創建專門的部分，並為我們的 NLP 模型提供更多數據以提高其性能並提高其準確性。","","C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\35H8HSVC\Khan et al. - 2023 - WeScribe An Intelligent Meeting Transcriber and A.pdf","","已整理; 會議記錄","Information extraction; Named entity recognition; NLP; Meeting transcriber; Text to speech","Pradeep Kumar Singh; Sławomir T.

The increased production of documents has gained so much momentum that their rate of production jumps two-fold every five years. These articles are searched over the internet via search engines, digital libraries, and citation indexes. However, the retrieval of relevant research papers for user queries is still a pipedream. This is because scientific documents are not indexed based on some subject classification hierarchies. Hence, the classification of these documents becomes a challenging task for the researchers. Classification of the documents can be two-fold: one way is to assign a single label to each document and the other is to assign multi-labels to each document based on its belonging domains. Classification of the documents can be performed by using either the available metadata or the whole content of the documents. While performing classification, there are many challenges which may belong to the dataset, feature selection technique, preprocessing methodology, and which classification model is suitable for the classification of the documents. This paper highlights the issues for single-label and multi-label classification by using either metadata or content of the documents and why metadata-based approaches are better than content-based approaches in terms of feasibility.","2023-01","2023-10-25 06:38:08","2024-03-26 15:01:03","2023-10-25 06:38:08","6804","","11","13","","","Single vs. Multi-Label","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","www.mdpi.com","","3 citations (Crossref) [2024-03-26] Number: 11 Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute titleTranslation: 單一標籤與多標籤：當代分類方案的問題、挑戰與見解","","C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\YBMLDWTR\Sajid et al. - 2023 - Single vs. Multi-Label The Issues, Challenges and.pdf","","回收; 已整理; 知識分類; 文獻分類","classification; data mining and ML; digital libraries; multi-label; single label","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Many research projects and companies are exploring the use of personalized applications that manage this deluge by tailoring the information presented to individual users. These applications all need to gather, and exploit, some information about individuals in order to be effective. This area is broadly called user profiling. This chapter surveys some of the most popular techniques for collecting information about users, representing, and building user profiles. In particular, explicit information techniques are contrasted with implicitly collected user information using browser caches, proxy servers, browser agents, desktop agents, and search logs. We discuss in detail user profiles represented as weighted keywords, semantic networks, and weighted concepts. We review how each of these profiles is constructed and give examples of projects that employ each of these techniques. Finally, a brief discussion of the importance of privacy protection in profiling is presented.","2007","2023-10-23 05:26:13","2024-03-26 15:01:10","2023-10-23 05:26:13","54-89","","","4321","","","","","","","","Springer Berlin Heidelberg","Berlin, Heidelberg","en","","","","","Semantic Scholar","","259 citations (Crossref) [2024-03-26] Book Title: The Adaptive Web Series Title: Lecture Notes in Computer Science DOI: 10.1007/978-3-540-72079-9_2 titleTranslation: 个性化信息访问的用户配置文件 abstractTranslation:  在线信息量呈指数级增长。虽然这些信息是宝贵的资源，但其数量限制了其价值。许多研究项目和公司都在探索使用个性化应用程序，通过为个人用户提供量身定制的信息来管理这些海量信息。这些应用程序都需要收集和利用一些有关个人的信息，以便发挥效用。这一领域被广泛称为用户特征分析。本章将介绍一些最常用的收集用户信息、代表用户和建立用户档案的技术。其中，显式信息技术与使用浏览器缓存、代理服务器、浏览器代理、桌面代理和搜索日志等隐式收集用户信息的技术形成了鲜明对比。我们详细讨论了以加权关键词、语义网络和加权概念表示的用户配置文件。我们回顾了每种配置文件的构建方法，并列举了采用每种技术的项目实例。最后，我们将简要讨论隐私保护在剖析中的重要性。","","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/User-Profiles-for-Personalized-Information-Access-Gauch-Speretta/0d6b69f39896b7216b2ee68f2a813b5068d3a67c","","","Peter Brusilovsky; Alfred Kobsa; Wolfgang Nejdl","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: The views of post-graduate students regarding information overload in real-time mobile web applications were assessed by sending/receiving questionnaires to the emails of 330 post-graduate students from the Kerman government universities who were chosen using Morgan's table sampling technique. The reliability of research questionnaires were analyzed in the SPSS software using Cronbach's alpha coefficient, which was 0.908 for this research. Results: The findings showed that the students had positive views about influencing factors of information overload, moderate views about personal influencing factors in dealing with information overload, positive views about effective tools for controlling information overload, moderate views about personal influencing and environmental factors in eliminating information overload, positive views about solutions for mitigating information overload, and negative views about the effects of information overload on users (P = 0.01). This means that all the independent variables directly affect the viewpoints of graduate students. Conclusions: The research results show that irrelevant information for the user, the amount of monitoring and evaluation of individuals and management of discussion groups, wrong and incorrect information, and violation of privacy are the main factors responsible for information overload. Furthermore, training programs on user interaction with information are considered as personal and environmental influencing factors in eliminating information overload. Management of personal knowledge, referring the work to professionals, and filtering the information are considered as important solutions for mitigating information overload, and informational stress and anxiety, despair and hopelessness in retrieving relevant information, informational fatigue, expenditure loss, reduced ability to think deeply, and reduced use of mental skills are considered as the most important effects of information overload on users.","2018-10-24","2023-10-23 05:45:30","2024-03-26 15:01:07","2023-10-23 05:45:30","","","In Press","In Press","","Interdiscip J Virtual Learn Med Sci","Information Overload in Real-Time Mobile Web Applications","","","","","","","en","","","","","Semantic Scholar","","0 citations (Crossref) [2024-03-26] titleTranslation: 即時移動 Web 應用程式中的資訊過載：學生觀點 abstractTranslation:  背景：本研究的主要目標是探討克爾曼研究生對即時行動 Web 應用程式中資訊過載的看法，以便為消除和控制資訊過載提供更好、更合適的解決方案。方法：透過向來自克爾曼政府大學的 330 名研究生的電子郵件發送/接收調查問卷，評估研究生對即時行動 Web 應用程式中資訊過載的看法，這些研究生是使用摩根表格抽樣技術選出的。在SPSS軟體中使用Cronbach's α係數對研究問卷的信度進行分析，本研究的α係數為0.908。結果：調查結果顯示，學生對資訊超載的影響因素持正面態度，對應對資訊超載的個人影響因素持中度態度，對控制資訊超載的有效工具持正面態度，對消除資訊超載的個人影響因素和環境因素持中度態度。資訊過載、對緩解資訊過載解決方案的正面看法以及對資訊過載對使用者影響的負面看法（P = 0.01）。這意味著所有自變數都直接影響研究生的觀點。結論：研究結果表明，與使用者無關的資訊、對個人的監控評估量和討論群組的管理、錯誤和不正確的資訊以及侵犯隱私是造成資訊過載的主要因素。此外，關於使用者與資訊互動的訓練計畫被認為是消除資訊過載的個人和環境影響因素。個人知識管理、將工作轉介給專業人員、過濾資訊被認為是緩解資訊過載、資訊壓力和焦慮、檢索相關資訊時的絕望和絕望、資訊疲勞、支出損失、深入思考能力下降的重要解決方案，而心理技能的減少被認為是資訊過載對使用者最重要的影響。","","C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\PPF6GKND\Negahban and Talawar - 2018 - Information Overload in Real-Time Mobile Web Appli.pdf; ","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Information-Overload-in-Real-Time-Mobile-Web-Negahban-Talawar/62a4749bd8769520fd925c6034971e22f89b4c67","使用者研究; 已整理; 資訊超載","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Senior researchers need reference papers regarding a similar topic they intend to search for and related topics as a new insight. In this research, scientific citation recommendation aims to find the most influential papers with similar and related topics. Related topic papers in serendipitous perspectives are reference papers that are novel, diversified and unexpected to a user. The unexpectedness of recommended papers can be papers with different topics to queries but still relevant. To accomplish these challenges, we propose a framework of scientific citation recommendation with serendipitous perspectives. The framework includes feature extraction of an academic citation network, selection of multi-topic communities, and ranking papers in the selected multi-topic communities by modified PageRank. Papers in the chosen communities tend to link to similar and related papers. Modified PageRank is an extension of personalized PageRank, which works on multi-topic communities and manuscript queries.

Developer-Artifact interactions indicate developers define or access pieces of information within artifacts. Developer-Developer interactions indicate the exchange of information among developers using a collaboration platform to clarify an issue, promote an idea, or expose any thoughtful comment. PROBLEM: The number of such interactions grows over time and makes it difficult to capture and assess the evolution of the developers’ knowledge about specific software project artifacts and tasks. Further, this knowledge decreases over time due to the natural limitations of human cognition that restrict our capabilities to cope with information overload. Besides, who has more knowledge about specific project elements are important to promote collaboration.

These models represent not only the knowledge developers have about these elements but also capture how this knowledge decreases over time based on forgetting and relearning functions. EVALUATION: An experimental study analyzed some developers’ interactions on artifacts for the purpose of predicting the evolution of developers’ knowledge in six software projects. The results show that the developers’ rankings by performed tasks and by our models have 72% or more of similarity.

Such logs are widely used for a variety of tasks, such as debugging, testing, program comprehension, and performance analysis. However, there exists no practical guidelines on how to write logging statements; hence, making the logging decision a very challenging task. There are two main challenges that developers are facing while making logging decisions: 1) Difficult to accurately and succinctly record execution behaviors; and 2) Hard to decide where to write logging statements. This thesis proposes a series of approaches to address the problems and help developers make logging decisions in two aspects: assist in making decisions on logging contents and on logging locations.

In this work, we look at keyword extraction from a number of different perspectives: Statistics, Automatic Term Indexing, Information Retrieval (IR), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and the emerging Neural paradigm. The 1990s have seen some early attempts to tackle the issue primarily based on text statistics [13, 17]. Meanwhile, in IR, efforts were largely led by DARPA’s Topic Detection and Tracking (TDT) project [2]. In this contribution, we discuss how past innovations paved a way for more recent developments, such as LDA, PageRank, and Neural Networks. We walk through the history of keyword extraction over the last 50 years, noting differences and similarities among methods that emerged during the time.

First, by analyzing the results of the learner’s structure diagram from 2018 to 2021, we calculated notable issues for summary thinking training, and based on this, we proposed a practical class plan. First, it was important to clearly maintain the distance between the learner, who is the subject of the text summary, and the original author of the text. This is an important principle for accurately understanding the text and also for understanding the learners themselves, who again are the subjects of the summary. Second, it was important to adjust the level of abstraction and generalization of text information. This abstraction generalization process is a process of considering abstract thinking and the relationship between texts by reflecting the key elements constituting the text in the structural diagram. Third, it was important to understand the text composition principle through the activity to check the hierarchy among the core information constituting the text. Some examples of possible classes to help us achieve the main goal for this summary thinking were introduced. First, we presented the process of internalizing the thinking process involved in abstract thinking through multi-faceted feedback activities on the structural diagram using abstract thinking. Second, in order to strengthen the process of understanding the internal relationship of the text structure, a method for internalizing the concept and thought process used in actual thinking was suggested by comparatively analyzing the meta-activities identified in the previous feedback process. Finally, a method to strengthen the openness of summary thinking was suggested by imparting that the structure drawing activity itself has an open possibility.","2022-02-28","2023-10-23 04:57:13","2024-03-26 15:01:19","2023-10-23 04:57:13","227-240","","1","16","","Korean J General Edu","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Semantic Scholar","","0 citations (Crossref) [2024-03-26] titleTranslation: 结构图教学法作为总结性思维的可视化过程 abstractTranslation:  本论文旨在提出一种在大学文科写作课中通过结构图将宏观结构可视化的抽象思维教学方法。首先，通过分析2018年至2021年学习者结构图的绘制结果，计算出总结性思维训练的显著问题，在此基础上提出切实可行的课堂教学方案。首先，要明确保持作为文本总结主体的学习者与文本原作者之间的距离。这是准确理解文本的重要原则，也是理解作为摘要主体的学习者本身的重要原则。其次，要调整文本信息的抽象概括程度。这个抽象概括的过程，就是通过在结构图中体现构成文本的关键要素，思考抽象思维和文本之间关系的过程。第三，要通过检查构成文本的核心信息之间的层次关系的活动来理解文本构成原理。我们介绍了一些可能的类例，以帮助我们实现本次总结思考的主要目标。首先，我们通过对结构图的多方位反馈活动，介绍了运用抽象思维内化抽象思维所涉及的思维过程。其次，为了加强对文本结构内部关系的理解过程，通过对比分析之前反馈过程中发现的元活动，提出了内化实际思考中使用的概念和思维过程的方法。最后，通过传授结构图绘制活动本身具有开放性的可能性，提出了加强总结思维开放性的方法。","","C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\ULI5G9S9\Kim - 2022 - A Teaching Methods of Structural Mapping as a Visu.pdf; ","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/A-Teaching-Methods-of-Structural-Mapping-as-a-of-Kim/dfaf0955958f78a5640349590199cc23fd63fa68","研究流程","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, there is no clear understanding of the meaning of the term, and while there have been many proposed definitions, there is no consensus. The goal of this work was to define the concept of “information overload”. In order to do so, a concept analysis using Rodgers' approach was performed.                                         Design/methodology/approach               A concept analysis using Rodgers' approach based on a corpus of documents published between 2010 and September 2020 was conducted. One surrogate for “information overload”, which is “cognitive overload” was identified. The corpus of documents consisted of 151 documents for information overload and ten for cognitive overload. All documents were from the fields of computer science and information science, and were retrieved from three databases: Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Digital Library, SCOPUS and Library and Information Science Abstracts (LISA).                                         Findings               The themes identified from the authors’ concept analysis allowed us to extract the triggers, manifestations and consequences of information overload. They found triggers related to information characteristics, information need, the working environment, the cognitive abilities of individuals and the information environment.

This article adopts a mixed-methods approach to understand the problem of information overload in personal informatics systems. We report findings from a 3-month study in which 20 participants collected multifaceted personal tracking data and used a system called Exist to reveal statistical correlations within their data. We explore the challenges that participants faced in reviewing the information presented by Exist, and we identify characteristics that exemplify “interesting” correlations. Based on these findings, we develop automated filtering mechanisms that aim to prevent information overload and support users in extracting interesting insights. Our approach deals with information overload by reducing the number of correlations shown to users by about 55% on average and increases the percentage of displayed correlations rated as interesting to about 81%, representing a 34 percentage point improvement over filters that only consider statistical significance at p < .05.

A traditional characteristic of IR systems is that if different users submit the same query, the system would yield the same list of results, regardless of the user. Personalised Information Retrieval (PIR) systems take a step further to better satisfy the user’s specific information needs by providing search results that are not only of relevance to the query but are also of particular relevance to the user who submitted the query. PIR has thereby attracted increasing research and commercial attention as information portals aim at achieving user loyalty by improving their performance in terms of effectiveness and user satisfaction. In order to provide a personalised service, a PIR system maintains information about the users and the history of their interactions with the system. This information is then used to adapt the users’ queries or the results so that information that is more relevant to the users is retrieved and presented. This survey paper features a critical review of PIR systems, with a focus on personalised search. The survey provides an insight into the stages involved in building and evaluating PIR systems, namely: information gathering, information representation, personalisation execution, and system evaluation. Moreover, the survey provides an analysis of PIR systems with respect to the scope of personalisation addressed. The survey proposes a classification of PIR systems into three scopes: individualised systems, community-based systems, and aggregate-level systems.

This paper reviews the problem of information overload, with particular reference to both individuals and business organizations. The paper tells that although the problem of information overload has existed for many years, in recent years the problem has become more widely recognized and practiced. The term ‘information overload’ has been recognized due to the rapid advances made by information and communication technology in the recent years, however, this does not make it clear whether this is making peoples life easier or more stressful. The paper reviews that even though there are hundreds and thousands of information available, it is still very difficult or even more stressful to find out the right information at the right time. Some solutions that are presented in order to solve the problem and reduce the information overload are: filtering the information, investing in knowledge and not information and the provision of value-added information (filtered by software or information curators). An emphasis is placed on technology as a tool and not the driver, while increased information literacy may provide the key to reducing information overload.","2015-03-04","2023-10-23 05:24:17","2024-02-21 10:25:22","2023-10-23 05:24:17","","","","","","","Information Overload","","","","","","","en","","","","","Semantic Scholar","","titleTranslation: 資訊過載：如何解決問題？當前技術趨勢及其對個人和組織的影響 abstractTranslation:  網路對改變每個人的生活產生了反思性的影響，尤其是讓消費者更參與利用網路創作內容和提供產品。本文回顧了資訊過載問題，特別是個人和商業組織。論文稱，儘管資訊過載問題已經存在多年，但近年來該問題已得到更廣泛的認識和實踐。近年來，由於資訊和通訊技術的快速發展，「資訊過載」一詞已得到認可，但這並不能明確這到底是讓人們的生活變得更輕鬆還是更有壓力。論文評論稱，儘管有成百上千的可用信息，但要在正確的時間找到正確的信息仍然非常困難，甚至壓力更大。為了解決問題並減少資訊過載而提出的一些解決方案是：過濾資訊、投資於知識而不是資訊以及提供增值資訊（由軟體或資訊管理者過濾）。重點強調技術作為工具而不是驅動力，而提高資訊素養可能是減少資訊過載的關鍵。","","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Information-Overload%3A-How-to-solve-the-problem-in-Daradkeh-Selimi/0afcbae81b22f17eb5ae1da8fb268d4883842cde","No DOI found","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

After several decades of research and development of the Internet, it is relatively easy for humans/machines to obtain information. However, there are new challenges in the post-Internet era, including information overload, fake information and the design of trustworthy, cost-effective autonomous systems. In order to address these challenges, we need to think about networking in a larger timescale. Actually, in order to facilitate humans' cooperation, we have invented technologies enabling networking for matter (grid of transportation), for energy (grid of energy), and for information (the Internet). In this article, we argue that the next networking paradigm could be intelligence networking, where intelligence can be easily obtained, like matter, energy, and information. Specifically, we present the motivations, scenarios and challenges of intelligence networking. In addition, we present a novel collective reinforcement learning scheme enabled by intelligence networking.

Previous studies find that website usability depends greatly upon its visual complexity which has significant effects on users' psychological perception and cognitive load. In this study, we use a page's outdegree as one measurement for its visual complexity. In general, outdegrees should be kept not too high in page design as large outdegrees are often signs of high page complexity which can adversely affect user navigation. This is particularly desirable and critical for maintaining website structures, because as a website evolves over time, the need for information also changes. Website structures must be updated periodically to align with users' information needs. In this process, obsolete links should be removed to avoid clustering of links that could cause information overload to users. However, the need to slim down website structures is understudied in the literature. In this paper, we propose a mathematical programming model that reduces information load by removing links from highly clustered pages while minimizing the impact to users. Results from tests on a real dataset indicate that the model not only significantly reduces page complexity with little impact on user navigation, but also can be solved effectively. The model is also tested on large synthetic datasets to demonstrate its remarkable scalability.","2018-06-01","2023-10-23 05:15:08","2024-03-26 15:01:15","2023-10-23 05:15:08","84-94","","","110","","Decision Support Systems","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","27 citations (Crossref) [2024-03-26] titleTranslation: 透過減少資訊過載來改善網站結構","","C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\H9W2VZNW\Chen - 2018 - Improving website structure through reducing infor.pdf; C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\QKF5UXMT\S0167923618300575.html","","人機互動","Information overload; Mathematical programming; Visual complexity; Website usability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The capabilities of AI/ML have expanded immensely over the past several years, and it is now being effectively used in software programs like Grammarly, a tool that provides intelligent feedback on writing skills including grammar, tone, and clarity. Grammarly has been uniquely successful as a feedback tool because it relies on lessons from cognitive science regarding student feedback and learning outcomes. Currently, there is no comparable software available for UI/UX, making it a uniquely untapped area for effective learning tools. The question that this thesis attempts to answer, therefore, is: How can the successes of Grammarly and established cognitive feedback principles inform the design of an AI/ML-based feedback tool for UI/UX design? To answer that question, this thesis explores previous work on AI/ML techniques, cognitive feedback theories, structural similarities between grammar and design, and design heuristics in order to ultimately define the theoretical groundwork for a “Grammarly for UI/UX design.”","2023","2023-10-23 04:58:28","2024-01-17 06:05:38","2023-10-23 04:58:28","","","","","","","Cognitive Feedback Theories and Artificial Intelligence","","","","","","","en","","","","","Semantic Scholar","","titleTranslation: 認知回饋理論與人工智慧：UI/UX 設計語法案例","","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Cognitive-Feedback-Theories-and-Artificial-A-Case-A-Paff/52058ea628cc0cf6e3975788903658e2f9727656","機器學習; 人機互動; 已整理; No DOI found","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Many engineering students focus on their professional future, and therefore do not understand the need to learn to research. Yet, the universities’ strong emphasis on scientific research, and the need for new generations of researchers requires that research skills are embedded also in the engineering curricula even at undergraduate level. As many engineering students are reluctant to read and write, the development of their scientific literacy skills requires many kinds of support. This paper describes pedagogical interventions implemented in a mechanical engineering bachelor’s thesis course to improve the quality of references of the theses and the completion of the thesis process in time. It also discusses the effects of systematic scaffolding of information literacy. Results show that the guided thesis process significantly improved the completion of bachelor’s thesis in the given time frame. However, statistically significant improvement in the quality and quantity of cited references could not be observed. This indicates that adding teaching sessions on information retrieval, scientific referencing, and scientific writing is not sufficient without close connection to the actual thesis supervision process performed by faculty.","2022-10-08","2023-10-23 04:35:09","2024-03-26 15:01:20","2023-10-23 04:35:08","1-6","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Semantic Scholar","","0 citations (Crossref) [2024-03-26] Conference Name: 2022 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE) ISBN: 9781665462440 Place: Uppsala, Sweden Publisher: IEEE titleTranslation: 加強本科工程學生論文工作的指導流程 abstractTranslation:  這篇創新的實務論文探討了結構化指導對學生論文工作過程的影響。許多工科學生專注於自己的職業未來，因此不明白學習研究的必要性。然而，大學對科學研究的高度重視，以及對新一代研究人員的需求，要求將研究技能納入工程課程，甚至在本科階段也是如此。由於許多工程系學生不願意閱讀和寫作，他們的科學素養技能的發展需要多種支持。本文描述了在機械工程學士論文課程中實施的教學幹預措施，以提高論文參考文獻的品質和及時完成論文過程。它還討論了資訊素養的系統支架的影響。結果表明，指導論文過程顯著提高了學士論文在給定時間內的完成率。然而，沒有觀察到引用參考文獻的品質和數量具有統計意義的顯著改善。這表明，如果不與教師實際的論文監督過程緊密結合，增加資訊檢索、科學參考和科學寫作的教學課程是不夠的。","","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Guided-process-to-enhance-undergraduate-engineering-Talikka-Naukkarinen/5fc41e0bab4f1f13e3c12806642668e6cdfb63d6","使用者研究; 研究流程","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The extraction of key information can also help researchers quickly obtain the information they want instead of reading through all potential documents. Recently, researchers have refocused their attention from words to sentences because utilizing sentences outperforms with respect to illustrating semantics and reduces the calculation complexity. We present a novel and lightweight automatic keyphrase extraction algorithm that does not depend on any external resources, including an external dictionary or corpus. Unlike traditional graph-based algorithms that iterate words to generate keyphrase lists, our proposal uses iterated sentences to rank words and generate keyphrase lists for the semantic information of sentences that are more complete than the word. We initialize the values of words with weighted information and generate a sentence score using these values. Then, we integrate sentences to update their values; hence, the values of the words are updated with the sentence information. We iterate this process until the values of the sentences and words converge. The proposed method is based on a measurement of the relations between sentences and an evaluation of the flow of these relations in an easily understood manner. These relationships are based on the hypothesis that the causality between adjacent sentences is semantically stronger than the causality between words. We not only increase the extraction accuracy, but also reduce the number of iterations of the algorithm. We compare our proposed method with five strong, popular baseline algorithms on four datasets. The results show that our proposed method performs better than the other algorithms on three evaluation metrics.","2021-07-08","2023-10-23 04:16:27","2024-03-26 15:01:21","2023-10-23 04:16:27","107014","","","223","","Knowledge-Based Systems","ISKE","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","3 citations (Crossref) [2024-03-26]","","C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\S756H5RZ\Chi and Hu - 2021 - ISKE An unsupervised automatic keyphrase extracti.pdf; C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\NSLB8KD5\S095070512100277X.html","","關鍵字","Keyphrase extraction; Graph-based; Iterated sentence; Unsupervised learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To identify both the barriers to undertaking action research and potential ways of overcoming those barriers, we survey 218 authors of 120 articles demonstrating empirical action research published in 12 of our good journals during the period 1982–2016. We received 70 usable responses. We also surveyed 52 editors of selected IS journals and received 25 usable responses. Our findings are revealing as they indicate both genuine barriers associated with action research and some apparent barriers that are in reality misperceptions or myths. In reflecting on these, we emphasize the special qualities of action research. We also reflect on the critical role that action research plays in the IS field as a whole and its potential for further contributions to research and practice, given the strong and close connections with organizational problem contexts that action research requires.

Inspired by the Information Search Process model, we divided the process into six stages and conducted three separate surveys that covered students’ feelings, thoughts and actions, as well as other important factors that might affect their behaviors in each of the stages. Our study shows that both the feelings and thoughts of students changed during the different stages of the process, and that they were generally consistent with the descriptions in the Information Search Process model. The study indicates that it is beneficial to use the Information Search Process model as the starting point for studying the student thesis-writing processes. As the outcome of the study, we ultimately proposed a multi-stage model for Chinese undergraduate students’ thesis-writing process.","2016-06-22","2023-10-20 09:47:20","2024-03-26 15:01:27","","","","","49","","Journal of Librarianship and Information Science","Undergraduate information behaviors in thesis writing","","","","","","","","","","","","ResearchGate","","7 citations (Crossref) [2024-03-26]","","","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/304344838_Undergraduate_information_behaviors_in_thesis_writing_A_study_using_the_Information_Search_Process_model","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

First, the significance and function of information retrieval course are illuminated. Then, one by one, the key points of the Information Retrieval are explained in the process of writing. Finally, the author described how to carry out the information retrieval, including selecting of the search tool, the search way, the retrieval method and so on for the college students' graduation thesis writing. It is the effective support for college student thesis, through the information retrieval to ensure the accuracy of the selected topic, the comprehensive of the collection of materials. Information retrieval course has become an important way to carry out information quality education in colleges and universities. In recent years, the information retrieval course has become a public basic course in many colleges and universities. Whether it is for the school or the ratio of starting courses, it has greatly enhanced students' information awareness and capability. [1] With the rapid development of modern information resources, learners change the habit of reading, more and more information resources are used by college students. Information resources are rich in content, not only the storage of information is large, but also has the advantages of high timeliness and high resource sharing, which is convenient for college students to carry out comprehensive, rapid and accurate literature retrieval. At present, most colleges and universities set the course as undergraduate elective courses, some colleges and universities set up undergraduate compulsory courses. Especially, it is very important to get information resources effectively, analysis and utilization to the graduate students for project research, thesis. Clarify the status of the course and integrate it into the reform of general education curriculum system in colleges and universities, and as the core curriculum of general education, set up information retrieval compulsory courses for undergraduates and postgraduates so as to enhance the readers' information accomplishment to the maximum extent. [2] It is worth studying on an important learning task for how to use the information retrieval, how to play a key role to information resources in college students thesis writing. At present, under the background of the information gathering, processing and transmission technology represented by computer, multimedia and network, the information network brings the opportunity and challenge to the traditional thesis writing. The paper writing itself is the process of expressing, exchanging and transmitting information. The ability to collect, process, use and create content directly influences the formation and efficiency of the writing process. Therefore, only to meet the requirements of the information society, have high information literacy, the students can competent and meet the needs of graduation thesis writing. [3] The Meaning and Role of Information Retrieval Courses Document retrieval is the process of collecting, organization, store of knowledge and information, and to search information for users. [4] We can get the documents needed in a large number of disordered literatures efficiently and conveniently through the literature search. The purpose of information retrieval course is to cultivate college students who have strong information awareness and information literacy, improve their self-learning ability, so that they can independently learn richer knowledge besides textbooks. [5] The final purpose of information retrieval course is that the students can learn and master the methods and skills of literature retrieval through the course, 7th International Conference on Education, Management, Computer and Medicine (EMCM 2016) Copyright © 2017, the Authors.

However, due to their dependence on external language models and the deterministic approach to weight boosting, their performance is limited. In this paper, we propose training neural contextual adapters for personalization in neural transducer based ASR models. Our approach can not only bias towards user-defined words, but also has the flexibility to work with pretrained ASR models. Using an in-house dataset, we demonstrate that contextual adapters can be applied to any general purpose pretrained ASR model to improve personalization. Our method outperforms shallow fusion, while retaining functionality of the pretrained models by not altering any of the model weights. We further show that the adapter style training is superior to full-fine-tuning of the ASR models on datasets with user-defined content.","2022-05","2023-10-30 06:25:56","2024-03-26 15:00:51","2023-10-30 06:25:56","8537-8541","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","19 citations (Crossref) [2024-03-26] ISSN: 2379-190X titleTranslation: 用於神經感測器中個性化語音識別的上下文適配器","","C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\2D8GXRHS\Sathyendra 等。 - 2022 - Contextual Adapters for Personalized Speech Recogn.pdf; C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\8SHMDXTZ\citations.html","","已整理; 語音辨識; 個人化語音辨識","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ICASSP 2022 - 2022 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We describe a fast and scalable algorithm that enables our biasing models to remain at the word-level, while applying the biasing at the subword level. This has the advantage of not requiring the biasing models to be dependent on any subword symbol table.

Big data represent the immense volume of complex data that show more details about behaviours, activities, and events that occur around the world. As a result, big data analytics needs to access diverse types of resources within a decreased response time to produce accurate and stable business experimentation that could help make brilliant decisions for organizations in real-time. These developments have spurred a revolutionary transformation in research, inventions, and business marketing. User behaviour analysis for classification and prediction is one of the hottest topics in data science. This type of analysis is performed for several purposes, such as finding users’ interests about a product (for marketing, e-commerce, etc.) or toward an event (elections, championships, etc.) and observing suspicious activities (security and privacy) based on their traits over the Internet. In this paper, a neuro-fuzzy approach for the classification and prediction of user behaviour is proposed. A dataset, composed of users’ temporal logs containing three types of information, namely, local machine, network and web usage logs, is targeted. To complement the analysis, each user’s 360-degree feedback is also utilized. Various rules have been implemented to address the company’s policy for determining the precise behaviour of a user, which could be helpful in managerial decisions. For prediction, a Gaussian Radial Basis Function Neural Network (GRBF-NN) is trained based on the example set generated by a Fuzzy Rule Based System (FRBS) and the 360-degree feedback of the user. The results are obtained and compared with other state-of-the-art schemes in the literature, and the scheme is found to be promising in terms of classification as well as prediction accuracy.","2019-11-21","2023-10-31 08:40:30","2024-03-26 15:00:48","2023-10-31 08:40:30","17","","1","8","","Journal of Cloud Computing","","","","","","","","en","","","","","BioMed Central","","36 citations (Crossref) [2024-03-26] titleTranslation: 用於使用者行為分類和預測的神經模糊方法","","C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\Y4HJG4HF\Atta-ur-Rahman et al. - 2019 - A Neuro-fuzzy approach for user behaviour classifi.pdf; C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\CI9LXSTX\s13677-019-0144-9.html","","數學; 已整理; 被引用; 模糊理論","Cloud computing; 360-degree feedback; Behaviour analysis; Big data; Classification; FRBS; Neuro-fuzzy; Prediction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For example, searching for a flight status or a game score returns a dynamically generated response along with supporting, pre-authored documents contextually relevant to the query. In this paper, we extend this hybrid search paradigm to data repositories that contain curated data sources and visualization content. We introduce a semantic search interface, Olio, that provides a hybrid set of results comprising both auto-generated visualization responses and pre-authored charts to blend analytical question-answering with content discovery search goals.

Although previous proof-of-concept studies have validated the effectiveness of Personal VAD, there are still several critical challenges to address before this model can be used in production: first, the quality must be satisfactory in both enrollment and enrollment-less scenarios; second, it should operate in a streaming fashion; and finally, the model size should be small enough to fit a limited latency and CPU/Memory budget. To meet the multi-faceted requirements, we propose a series of novel designs: 1) advanced speaker embedding modulation methods; 2) a new training paradigm to generalize to enrollment-less conditions; 3) architecture and runtime optimizations for latency and resource restrictions.

To enhance the services of TCM, many works focus on constructing various types of TCM knowledge graphs according to the concrete requirements such as information retrieval. However, most of them ignored several key issues. One is temporal information that is very important for TCM clinical diagnosis and treatment. For example, a herb needs to be boiled for different periods in different prescriptions, but existing methods cannot represent this temporal information very well. The other is that current TCM-based retrieval systems cannot effectively deal with the temporal intentions of search sentences, which leads to bad experiences for users in retrieval services. To solve these issues, we propose a new model tailored for TCM based on the temporal knowledge graph in this paper, which can effectively represent the clinical knowledge changing dynamically over time. Moreover, we implement a temporal semantic search system and employ reasoning rules based on our proposed model to complete the temporal intentions of search sentences. The preliminary result indicates that our system can obtain better results than existing methods in terms of precision.","2020","2023-11-16 02:16:40","2024-03-26 15:00:45","","13-20","","","","","","","Communications in Computer and Information Science","","","","Springer","Singapore","en","","","","","Springer Link","","2 citations (Crossref) [2024-03-26] titleTranslation: 基於時態知識圖的中醫時態語意搜尋系統","","C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\5VT4XDPV\Yang et al. - 2020 - A Temporal Semantic Search System for Traditional .pdf","","中醫; 知識圖譜; 回收; 已整理; 問答系統","Traditional Chinese medicine; Temporal intention; Temporal knowledge graph; Temporal semantic search","Xin Wang; Francesca A.

Due to frequently updating APIs, programmers are prompted to frequently consult API documents in the process of software development. However, the traditional query approaches of the documents have certain limitations. For example, the programmers need to know the API name as a prerequisite and are often unable to obtain the expected search results because of the difference in understanding between the description of the problem and the description of the documents. Only these “known-unknown” information can be queried, and it is difficult to query the “unknown-unknown” information. To address the limitations, we establish the knowledge graph of software source code combined with knowledge which is derived from the documents, Github project code warehouse, Stack overflow platform, and local project code warehouse.

Existing methods are classified to relational stores and native graph stores. Relational stores are able to store large-scale knowledge graphs and convenient in updating knowledge, but the query performance weakens obviously when the selectivity of a knowledge graph query is large. Native graph stores are efficient in processing complex knowledge graph queries due to its index-free adjacent property, but they are inapplicable to manage a large-scale knowledge graph due to limited storage budgets or inflexible updating process. Motivated by this, we propose a dual-store structure which leverages a graph store to accelerate the complex query process in the relational store. However, it is challenging to determine what data to transfer from relational store to graph store at what time. To address this problem, we formulate it as a Markov Decision Process and derive a physical design tuner \sf DOTILDOTIL based on reinforcement learning. With \sf DOTILDOTIL, the dual-store structure is adaptive to dynamic changing workloads. Experimental results on real knowledge graphs demonstrate that our proposed dual-store structure improves query performance up to average 50.11 percent compared with the most commonly used relational stores.","2023-02","2023-11-23 00:05:34","2024-03-26 15:00:43","2023-11-23 00:05:34","1104-1118","","2","35","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","6 citations (Crossref) [2024-03-26] Conference Name: IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering titleTranslation: 知識圖的雙儲存結構","","C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\7ZTDAFGB\9468312.html; C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\7WWDBB8F\Qi 等。 - 2023 - A Dual-Store Structure for Knowledge Graphs.pdf","","知識圖譜; 已整理; 儲存方式","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Traditional information retrieval techniques do not perform well on non-factoid questions. Recent neural question answering systems are reported to have performance gains over traditional methods. However, little attention has been given to HQA as datasets are generally too small to train a neural model from scratch. Recently, several systems have been proposed to learn context representations for HQA. Despite moderate progress, these systems have not been thoroughly compared with state-of-the-art neural models, and these neural models were tested only on self-created datasets. This makes it difficult for practitioners to decide which models should be used for various scenarios. To address the above challenges, we develop a new joint model to incorporate both context and knowledge embeddings into neural ranking architectures. First, we adapt context embedding pre-trained from large open-domain corpus to small healthcare datasets. Second, we learn knowledge embedding from knowledge graphs to provide external information for understanding non-factoid questions. To evaluate how context or knowledge embedding can benefit HQA, we adapt many state-of-the-art methods for general QA to HQA, by injecting the context or knowledge information only, or both of them. Extensive experiments are conducted to compare our approach with those adapted methods and current HQA systems. The results show that our approach achieves the state-of-the-art performance on both HealthQA and NFCorpus datasets.","2023-01","2023-11-23 03:00:57","2024-03-26 15:00:41","2023-11-23 03:00:57","575-588","","1","35","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","1 citations (Crossref) [2024-03-26] Conference Name: IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering titleTranslation: 背景或知識如何有益於醫療保健問答？","","C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\QSTZWQK5\9459504.html; C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\CFDDGVJ5\Wang et al. - 2023 - How Context or Knowledge Can Benefit Healthcare Qu.pdf","","機器學習; 重要; 知識圖譜; 已整理; 問答系統","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel Time-aware Multiway Adaptive (TMA) fusion network. Inspired by the step-by-step reasoning behavior of humans. For each given question, TMA first extracts the relevant concepts from the KG, and then feeds them into a multiway adaptive module to produce a temporal-specific representation of the question. This representation can be incorporated with the pre-trained KG embedding to generate the final prediction. Empirical results verify that the proposed model achieves better performance than the state-of-the-art models in the benchmark dataset. Notably, the Hits@1 and Hits@10 results of TMA on the CronQuestions dataset’s complex questions are absolutely improved by 24% and 10% compared to the best-performing baseline. Furthermore, we also show that TMA employing an adaptive fusion mechanism can provide interpretability by analyzing the proportion of information in question representations.","2023-06","2023-11-23 03:07:48","2024-03-26 15:00:40","2023-11-23 03:07:48","1-5","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","1 citations (Crossref) [2024-03-26] ISSN: 2379-190X titleTranslation: 用於時態知識圖問答的時間感知多路自適應融合網絡","","C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\TXZPDL68\10095395.html; C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\BB2N99LR\Liu et al. - 2023 - Time-Aware Multiway Adaptive Fusion Network for Te.pdf","","機器學習; 知識圖譜; 回收; 已整理; 問答系統","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ICASSP 2023 - 2023 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Two of the most widely studied and built QA systems are Natural Language Question Answering (NLQA) and Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA). NLQA relies on sequence learning algorithms, which have limitations on the length of input they can handle, while KGQA relies on the Subject-Predicate-Object (SPO) tuple representation of data, which may not always be available in the knowledge graph. In this paper, we present a novel approach for addressing these challenges by utilizing the structural information from the Knowledge Graph (KG) and the semantic information from the Natural Language Context. Due to the lack of a dataset to enable this approach, we propose the creation of a multi-view dataset - MTL-QA, specifically designed for multi-task learning. We also present a multi-task learning approach to jointly train NLQA and KGQA models and demonstrate the effectiveness on the proposed MTL-QA dataset.","2023-03","2023-11-23 03:33:09","2024-03-26 15:00:36","2023-11-23 03:33:08","296-301","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","0 citations (Crossref) [2024-03-26] ISSN: 2154-4360 titleTranslation: 文字和知識雙重視角的資料集和多任務多視圖問答方法","","C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\CM5VWBIW\10111327.html; C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\69N6GXIH\MS et al. - 2023 - A Dataset and Multi-task Multi-view Approach for Q.pdf","","機器學習; 知識圖譜; 回收; 已整理; 問答系統; KBQA; NLQA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2023 15th International Conference on Computer and Automation Engineering (ICCAE)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Knowledge bases are multi-relational graphs consisting of entities and relations representing facts about the world. These facts follow a controlled vocabulary that drives the knowledge base, often called ontology. Entities are the graph nodes, while relations are the edges connecting the nodes. While knowledge base attention prolifer-ates, extracting information from these resources is challenging. One of the promising approaches is Question Answering systems. The Question Answering over Knowledge Base(KB-QA) system aims to provide a natural language interface to pose a query to the KB. QA systems use embeddings to map the posed Question to the facts stored in the knowledge bases. QA systems can be effectively improved using large transformer models. These transformer models are computationally expensive, which prevents their use in real-world applications. To solve this, we started our study with the use-case of Knowledge Base Question Answering systems. In KB-QA systems, representing the entities and relationships play a pivotal role in extracting the answer to the posed query. Traditional KB embedding techniques represent entities/relations as vectors, mapping them in different semantic spaces and ignoring the subtle cor-relation. A pre-training language model for encoding the KB facts will preserve the semantic and contextual correlation. While learning linguistic knowledge, these models also store relational knowledge in the training data. These Language Models are often trained on a massive corpus addressing the Out-Of- Vocabulary problem. In this paper, we incorporate a co-embedding model for knowledge base embedding, which learns low-dimensional representations of entities and relations in the same semantic space. We propose a Variational Auto-Encoder, an efficient transformer architecture that represents knowledge base representations as Gaussian distributions to address the issue of neglecting uncertainty. In addition, our method has high quality and interpretability advantages compared with previous methods. Our experimental results show the effectiveness and the superiority of the VAE approach for question-answering systems on knowledge bases over other well-known pre-trained embedding methods.","2022-02","2023-11-23 03:38:21","2024-03-26 15:00:35","2023-11-23 03:38:21","29-36","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","0 citations (Crossref) [2024-03-26] titleTranslation: 使用變分自動編碼器對知識庫進行問答","","C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\GRDENRKI\9999076.html; C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\TR366BFE\Japa and Green - 2022 - Question Answering over Knowledge Base with Variat.pdf","","BERT; 機器學習; 知識圖譜; 已整理; 問答系統","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022 IEEE Eighth International Conference on Multimedia Big Data (BigMM)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In addition, most previous works built on either RNN-or Transformer-based models to encode a linearized KG subgraph, which totally discards the explicit structure information of a KG subgraph. To address this issue, we propose to apply a bidirectional Graph2Seq model to encode the KG subgraph.

The accuracy of query grammar generation is therefore important in determining whether a Question Answering system can produce a correct answer. Generally speaking, incorrect query grammar will never find the right answer. SPARQL is the most frequently used query language in question answering systems. In the past, SPARQL was generated based on graph structures, such as dependency trees, syntax trees and so on. However, the query cost of generating SPARQL is high, which creates long processing times to answer questions. To reduce the query cost, this work proposes a low-cost SPARQL generator named Light-QAWizard, which integrates multi-label classification into a recurrent neural network (RNN), builds a template classifier, and generates corresponding query grammars based on the results of template classifier. Light-QAWizard reduces query frequency to DBpedia by aggregating multiple outputs into a single output using multi-label classification. In the experimental results, Light-QAWizard’s performance on Precision, Recall and F-measure metrics were evaluated on the QALD-7, QALD8 and QALD-9 datasets. Not only did Light-QAWizard outperform all other models, but it also had a lower query cost that was nearly half that of QAWizard.","2022","2023-11-23 04:05:50","2024-03-26 15:00:31","2023-11-23 04:05:50","99850-99860","","","10","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","2 citations (Crossref) [2024-03-26] Conference Name: IEEE Access titleTranslation: 用於問答系統的高效 SPARQL 查詢產生器","","C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\EWNRGJRU\9893129.html; C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\KIK5SPJF\Chen et al. - 2022 - Efficient SPARQL Queries Generator for Question An.pdf","","機器學習; SPARQL; 已整理; 問答系統; 問題分析","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To generate Complex Questions a Rule-Based Algorithm is used. To generate Multiple Choice Questions and Fill in the Blanks type questions, a Vector Algorithm from the GLoVe Model is used along with Rule-Based Algorithms.

However, the capability of LLMs on table reasoning tasks is yet to be explored. In this paper, we aim at understanding how well LLMs can perform table-related tasks with few-shot in-context learning. Specifically, we evaluated LLMs on popular table QA and fact verification datasets like WikiTableQuestion, FetaQA, TabFact, and FEVEROUS and found that LLMs are competent at complex reasoning over table structures, though these models are not pre-trained on any table corpus. When combined with `chain of thoughts' prompting, LLMs can achieve very strong performance with only a 1-shot demonstration, even on par with some SoTA models. We show that LLMs are even more competent at generating comprehensive long-form answers on FetaQA than tuned T5-large. We further manually studied the reasoning chains elicited from LLMs and found that these reasoning chains are highly consistent with the underlying semantic form.

Therefore, there is growing interest in exploring whether ChatGPT can replace traditional knowledge-based question answering (KBQA) models. Although there have been some works analyzing the question answering performance of ChatGPT, there is still a lack of large-scale, comprehensive testing of various types of complex questions to analyze the limitations of the model. In this paper, we present a framework that follows the black-box testing specifications of CheckList proposed by [38]. We evaluate ChatGPT and its family of LLMs on eight real-world KB-based complex question answering datasets, which include six English datasets and two multilingual datasets. The total number of test cases is approximately 190,000.

Nevertheless, challenges from both data and knowledge aspects remain as obstacles, constraining the social media-based detection performance. Data implicitness and sparsity make it difficult to discover the inner true intentions of individuals based on their posts. Inspired by psychological studies, we build and unify a high-level suicide-oriented knowledge graph with deep neural networks for suicidal ideation detection on social media. We further design a two-layered attention mechanism to explicitly reason and establish key risk factors to individual's suicidal ideation. The performance study on microblog and Reddit shows that: 1) with the constructed personal knowledge graph, the social media-based suicidal ideation detection can achieve over 93% accuracy; and 2) among the six categories of personal factors, post, personality, and experience are the top-3 key indicators.

Hence, as a first step, we exploit the personal factual relation triples from Freebase to mine natural language snippets with a search engine, and the resulting snippets containing pairs of related entities to create the training data. This data is then used to build three key language understanding components: (1) Personal Assertion Classification identifies the user utterances that are relevant with personal facts, e.g., “my mother's name is Rosa”; (2) Relation Detection classifies the personal assertion utterance into one of the predefined relation classes, e.g., “parents”; and (3) Slot Filling labels the attributes or arguments of relations, e.g., “name(parents): Rosa”. Our experiments using the Microsoft conversational understanding system demonstrate the performance of this proposed approach on the population of personal knowledge graphs.","2014-02","2023-12-03 17:24:09","2024-03-26 15:00:17","2023-12-03 17:24:09","224-229","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","10 citations (Crossref) [2024-03-26] titleTranslation: 對話理解中使用者話語的個人知識圖譜","","C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\5DIJAGFY\7078578.html; C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\8YB8ALT7\Li et al. - 2014 - Personal knowledge graph population from user utte.pdf","","語音識別; 知識圖譜; 回收; 已整理","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2014 IEEE Spoken Language Technology Workshop (SLT)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The KGs are not easily accessible to end-users because they need an understanding of query languages and KGs’ structures. To assist end-users in accessing these KGs, question answering over KGs targets to provide answers for natural language questions (NLQs). This paper proposes an approach to answer questions over small and medium scaled KGs based on graph isomorphism in two phases: (1) offline phase and (2) semantic parsing phase. In the offline phase, a semi-automated solution is proposed to generate NLQs and their answers, which are used to train machine learning models employed in the next phase. In the semantic parsing phase, a given input NLQ is mapped into a query pattern according to its grammatical structure. Each query pattern contains some slots that need to be filled with corresponding entities, classes and relations from the KG. While string and semantic similarity metrics are applied to identify the entities and classes, the probability distribution of the relations is used to extract the relations. The Cartesian product of the identified entities, classes and relations is utilized to fill the slots, derive SPARQL queries and finally retrieve the answers. To evaluate the proposed approach, we use SalzburgerLand KG, a real KG describing touristic entities of the region of Salzburg, Austria. Our results show that the approach improves the end-to-end user experience in terms of interactive question answering and performance.","2022","2023-12-01 15:38:45","2024-03-26 15:00:21","2023-12-01 15:38:45","69788-69801","","","10","","","Question Answering Over Knowledge Graphs","","","","","","","en","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","5 citations (Crossref) [2024-03-26] Conference Name: IEEE Access titleTranslation: 基於知識圖的問答：旅遊業案例研究","","C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\I3FUNAN6\9810255.html; C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\S7E38NXF\Aghaei 等。 - 2022 - Question Answering Over Knowledge Graphs A Case S.pdf","","問答系統; 待整理","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Current solutions usually employ expert systems that classify records based on their metadata, but this approach is becoming unfeasible due to the increased variety of records and a growing lack of metadata. Text classification is a promising alternative now that the records themselves are machine readable. In this study, the performance of traditional text classification techniques was compared to newer natural language processing technologies in a series of experiments using authentic records data. While the latest Transformer language models showed superior classification skill, traditional methods still perform well. These results were discussed by a focus group of record managers, who believe that text classification can help them manage risk and meet compliance obligations.

Choosing the best tool to extract specific content elements is difficult because many, technically diverse tools are available, but recent performance benchmarks are rare. Moreover, such benchmarks typically cover only a few content elements like header metadata or bibliographic references and use smaller datasets from specific academic disciplines. We provide a large and diverse evaluation framework that supports more extraction tasks than most related datasets. Our framework builds upon DocBank, a multi-domain dataset of 1.5M annotated content elements extracted from 500K pages of research papers on arXiv. Using the new framework, we benchmark ten freely available tools in extracting document metadata, bibliographic references, tables, and other content elements from academic PDF documents. GROBID achieves the best metadata and reference extraction results, followed by CERMINE and Science Parse. For table extraction, Adobe Extract outperforms other tools, even though the performance is much lower than for other content elements. All tools struggle to extract lists, footers, and equations. We conclude that more research on improving and combining tools is necessary to achieve satisfactory extraction quality for most content elements.

We present TinyGenius, a methodology to validate NLP-extracted scholarly knowledge statements using microtasks performed with crowdsourcing.

The practice of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) began several thousand years ago, and the knowledge of practitioners is recorded in paper and electronic versions of case notes, manuscripts, and books in multiple languages. Developing a method of information extraction (IE) from these sources to generate a cohesive data set would be a great contribution to the medical field. The goal of this study was to perform a systematic review of the status of IE from TCM sources over the last 10 years. Methods. We conducted a search of four literature databases for articles published from 2010 to 2021 that focused on the use of natural language processing (NLP) methods to extract information from unstructured TCM text data. Two reviewers and one adjudicator contributed to article search, article selection, data extraction, and synthesis processes. Results. We retrieved 1234 records, 49 of which met our inclusion criteria. We used the articles to (i) assess the key tasks of IE in the TCM domain, (ii) summarize the challenges to extracting information from TCM text data, and (iii) identify effective frameworks, models, and key findings of TCM IE through classification. Conclusions. Our analysis showed that IE from TCM text data has improved over the past decade. However, the extraction of TCM text still faces some challenges involving the lack of gold standard corpora, nonstandardized expressions, and multiple types of relations.

WebQA mirrors the way humans use the web: 1) Ask a question, 2) Choose sources to aggregate, and 3) Produce a fluent language response. This is the behavior we should be expecting from IoT devices and digital assistants. Existing work prefers to assume that a model can either reason about knowledge in images or in text. WebQA includes a secondary text-only QA task to ensure improved visual performance does not come at the cost of language understanding.

Previous studies of Electronic Lab Notebooks (ELNs) in academia and industry have identified semantic web technologies as a means for organising scientific documents to improve current workflows and knowledge management practices. In this paper, we present a qualitative, user-centred study of researcher requirements and practices, based on a series of discipline-specific focus groups. We developed a prototype semantic ELN to serve as a discussion aid for these focus groups, and to help us explore the technical readiness of a range of semantic web technologies. While these technologies showed potential, existing tools for semantic annotation were not well-received by our focus groups, and need to be refined before they can be used to enhance current researcher practices. In addition, the seemingly simple notion of “tagging and searching” documents appears anything but; the researchers in our focus groups had extremely personal requirements for how they organise their work, so the successful incorporation of semantic web technologies into their practices must permit a significant degree of customisation and personalisation.","2019-03-21","2023-12-21 05:50:41","2024-03-26 15:00:09","2023-12-21 05:50:41","23","","1","11","","Journal of Cheminformatics","Too many tags spoil the metadata","","","","","","","en","","","","","BioMed Central","","11 citations (Crossref) [2024-03-26] titleTranslation: 太多的標籤破壞了元資料：利用語意網路技術研究科學研究的知識管理 abstractTranslation:  科學研究越來越以其產生的文件和數據量為特徵，從實驗計劃和原始數據到報告和論文。研究人員經常難以單獨或集體管理和整理這些資料。學術界和工業界先前對電子實驗室筆記本 (ELN) 的研究已將語義網路技術確定為組織科學文件以改善當前工作流程和知識管理實踐的一種手段。在本文中，我們基於一系列特定學科焦點小組，對研究人員的要求和實踐進行了定性、以使用者為中心的研究。我們開發了一個語意 ELN 原型，作為這些焦點小組的討論輔助工具，並幫助我們探索一系列語意 Web 技術的技術準備。雖然這些技術顯示出潛力，但現有的語義註釋工具並未受到我們的焦點小組的歡迎，需要進行改進才能用於增強當前研究人員的實踐。此外，「標記與搜尋」文件這看似簡單的概念其實並非如此；我們焦點小組的研究人員對於如何組織他們的工作有著極其個人化的要求，因此語義網路技術成功地融入他們的實踐中必須允許很大程度的客製化和個性化。","","C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\7HLQ4TTV\Too many tags spoil the metadata： investigating the knowledge management of scientific research with semantic web technologies.pdf; C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\SWQ4N2WL\s13321-019-0345-8.html","","重要; 待讀; 研究流程; 數位實驗筆記; 標籤","Ontologies; Document management; Scientific documents; Semantic tagging","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There are diverse algorithms being proposed and various benchmark datasets with different topics and task formats being constructed. QA software has also been widely used in daily human life now. However, current QA software is mainly tested in a reference-based paradigm, in which the expected outputs (labels) of test cases need to be annotated with much human effort before testing. As a result, neither the just-in-time test during usage nor the extensible test on massive unlabeled real-life data is feasible, which keeps the current testing of QA software from being flexible and sufficient. In this paper, we propose a method, qaAskeR, with three novel Metamorphic Relations for testing QA software. qaAskeR does not require the annotated labels but tests QA software by checking its behaviors on multiple recursively asked questions that are related to the same knowledge. Experimental results show that qaAskeR can reveal violations at over 80% of valid cases without using any preannotated labels. Diverse answering issues, especially the limited generalization on question types across datasets, are revealed on a state-of-the-art QA algorithm.","2021-01","2024-01-15 00:19:14","2024-03-26 15:00:00","2024-01-15 00:19:14","104-116","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","11 citations (Crossref) [2024-03-26] ISSN: 2643-1572 titleTranslation: 透過遞歸提問來測試您的問答軟體","","C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\TTAKWGDE\9678670.html","","資料集; 已整理; 問答系統; benchmark","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021 36th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering (ASE)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Based on the fusion adaptive resonance theory, the proposed model can observe and memorize the content of daily events in five aspects: 1) people; 2) activities; 3) times; 4) places; and 5) objects. The model is based on the human memory pipeline, containing a working memory and a two-layer long-term memory model, which can effectively merge, cluster, and summarize past memories based on their context and relevance in a self-organizing manner. When providing memory assistance, the robot can analyze a user query and find the best matching memory cluster to generate verbal cues to stimulate recalling of the target event. Moreover, using reinforcement learning, the robot eventually learns the most effective mapping of cue types to event type through social interaction. Experiments show the feasibility of the proposed model, which can handle episodic events with elasticity and stability. Moreover, there is evidence that the robot is able to provide robust memory assistance from knowledge obtained through previous observations, with 99% confidence, intervals in the participants’ mean recall percentage of the events increases 19.63% after receiving memory assistance from the robot.","2022-06","2024-01-14 22:20:38","2024-03-26 15:00:01","2024-01-14 22:20:38","617-628","","2","14","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","4 citations (Crossref) [2024-03-26] Conference Name: IEEE Transactions on Cognitive and Developmental Systems titleTranslation: 用於記憶輔助機器人的受大腦啟發的自組織情景記憶模型","","C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\Y5FP6332\9361701.html","","已整理; 私人; 記憶; 問答","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These systems are designed to interact with patients, collect evidence about their symptoms and relevant antecedents, and possibly make predictions about the underlying diseases. Doctors would review the interactions, including the evidence and the predictions, collect if necessary additional information from patients, before deciding on next steps. Despite recent progress in this area, an important piece of doctors' interactions with patients is missing in the design of these systems, namely the differential diagnosis. Its absence is largely due to the lack of datasets that include such information for models to train on. In this work, we present a large-scale synthetic dataset of roughly 1.3 million patients that includes a differential diagnosis, along with the ground truth pathology, symptoms and antecedents for each patient. Unlike existing datasets which only contain binary symptoms and antecedents, this dataset also contains categorical and multi-choice symptoms and antecedents useful for efficient data collection. Moreover, some symptoms are organized in a hierarchy, making it possible to design systems able to interact with patients in a logical way. As a proof-of-concept, we extend two existing AD and ASD systems to incorporate the differential diagnosis, and provide empirical evidence that using differentials as training signals is essential for the efficiency of such systems or for helping doctors better understand the reasoning of those systems.","2022-10-13","2024-01-13 02:37:48","2024-01-17 06:05:10","2024-01-13 02:37:48","","","","","","","DDXPlus","","","","","arXiv","","en","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv:2205.09148 [cs] titleTranslation: DDXPlus：用於自動醫療診斷的新資料集","","C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\ND25CKPU\Tchango 等。 - 2022 - DDXPlus A New Dataset For Automatic Medical Diagn.pdf; C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\H94SAHWT\2205.html","","資料集; 已整理; 西醫; OpenReview","Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science - Computation and Language; Computer Science - Machine Learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2205.09148","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The readability of log messages in the logging statements (i.e., the descriptive text) is rather crucial to the value of the generated logs. Immature log messages may slow down or even obstruct the process of log analysis. Despite the importance of log messages, there is still a lack of standards on what constitutes good readability of log messages and how to write them. In this paper, we conduct a series of interviews with 17 industrial practitioners to investigate their expectations on the readability of log messages. Through the interviews, we derive three aspects related to the readability of log messages, including Structure, Information, and Wording, along with several specific practices to improve each aspect. We validate our findings through a series of online questionnaire surveys and receive positive feedback from the participants. We then manually investigate the readability of log messages in large-scale open source systems and find that a large portion (38.1%) of the log messages have inadequate readability. Motivated by such observation, we further explore the potential of automatically classifying the readability of log messages using deep learning and machine learning models. We find that both deep learning and machine learning models can effectively classify the readability of log messages with a balanced accuracy above 80.0% on average. Our study provides comprehensive guidelines for composing log messages to further improve practitioners' logging practices.","2023-09","2024-01-17 06:02:13","2024-03-26 14:59:53","2024-01-17 06:02:13","129-140","","","","","","Are They All Good?","","","","","","","en","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","0 citations (Crossref) [2024-03-26] ISSN: 2643-1572 titleTranslation: 他們都好嗎？研究從業者對日誌訊息可讀性的期望","","C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\YQA4JY2Z\10298380.html; C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\TP2H3SVW\Li et al. - 2023 - Are They All Good Studying Practitioners' Expecta.pdf","","使用者研究; 已整理; log","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2023 38th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering (ASE)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One of the first and most important steps of automated log analysis is log abstraction, which parses the raw logs into a structured format. Prior log abstraction techniques aim to identify and abstract all the dynamic variables in logs and output a static log template for automated log analysis. However, these abstracted dynamic variables may also contain important information that is useful to different tasks in log analysis. In this paper, we investigate the characteristics of dynamic variables and their importance in practice, and explore the potential of a variable-aware log abstraction technique. Through manual investigations and surveys with practitioners, we find that different categories of dynamic variables record various information that can be important depending on the given tasks, the distinction of dynamic variables in log abstraction can further assist in log analysis. We then propose a deep learning based log abstraction approach, named VALB, which can identify different categories of dynamic variables and preserve the value of specified categories of dynamic variables along with the log templates (i.e., variable-aware log abstraction). Through the evaluation on a widely used log abstraction benchmark, we find that VALB outperforms other state-of-the-art log abstraction techniques on general log abstraction (i.e., when abstracting all the dynamic variables) and also achieves a high variable-aware log abstraction accuracy that further identifies the category of the dynamic variables. Our study highlights the potential of leveraging the important information recorded in the dynamic variables to further improve the process of log analysis.","2023-05","2024-01-17 06:03:20","2024-03-26 14:59:53","2024-01-17 06:03:20","830-842","","","","","","Did We Miss Something Important?","","","","","","","en","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","3 citations (Crossref) [2024-03-26] ISSN: 1558-1225 titleTranslation: 我們錯過了一些重要的事情嗎？研究和探索變數感知日誌抽象","","C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\8J8IC2CD\10172652.html; C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\XSAX2VZX\Li et al. - 2023 - Did We Miss Something Important Studying and Expl.pdf","","機器學習; 已整理; log","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2023 IEEE/ACM 45th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, deciding where to insert logging statements is a crucial yet challenging task. On one hand, logging too little may increase the maintenance difficulty due to missing important system execution information. On the other hand, logging too much may introduce excessive logs that mask the real problems and cause significant performance overhead. Prior studies provide recommendations on logging locations, but such recommendations are only for limited situations (e.g., exception logging) or at a coarse-grained level (e.g., method level). Thus, properly helping developers decide finer-grained logging locations for different situations remains an unsolved challenge. In this paper, we tackle the challenge by first conducting a comprehensive manual study on the characteristics of logging locations in seven open-source systems. We uncover six categories of logging locations and find that developers usually insert logging statements to record execution information in various types of code blocks. Based on the observed patterns, we then propose a deep learning framework to automatically suggest logging locations at the block level. We model the source code at the code block level using the syntactic and semantic information. We find that: 1) our models achieve an average of 80.1% balanced accuracy when suggesting logging locations in blocks; 2) our cross-system logging suggestion results reveal that there might be an implicit logging guideline across systems. Our results show that we may accurately provide finer-grained suggestions on logging locations, and such suggestions may be shared across systems.","2021-01-27","2024-01-17 06:04:11","2024-03-26 14:59:52","2024-01-16","361–372","","","","","","Where shall we log?","ASE '20","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","en","","","","","ACM Digital Library","","20 citations (Crossref) [2024-03-26]","","C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\PWP9RWYX\Li et al. - 2021 - Where shall we log studying and suggesting loggin.pdf","","機器學習; 已整理; log","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Protocols in ELNs contain a detailed description of the conducted steps including the necessary information to understand the procedure and the raised research data as well as to reproduce the research investigation. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether such ELN protocols can be used to create semantic documentation of the provenance of research data by the use of ontologies and linked data methodologies. Methods Based on an ELN protocol of a biomedical wet-lab experiment, a retrospective provenance model of the raised research data describing the details of the experiment in a machine-interpretable way is manually engineered. Furthermore, an automated approach for knowledge acquisition from ELN protocols is derived from these results. This structure-based approach exploits the structure in the experiment’s description such as headings, tables, and links, to translate the ELN protocol into a semantic knowledge representation. To satisfy the Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reuseable (FAIR) guiding principles, a ready-to-publish bundle is created that contains the research data together with their semantic documentation. Results While the manual modelling efforts serve as proof of concept by employing one protocol, the automated structure-based approach demonstrates the potential generalisation with seven ELN protocols. For each of those protocols, a ready-to-publish bundle is created and, by employing the SPARQL query language, it is illustrated that questions about the processes and the obtained research data can be answered. Conclusions The semantic documentation of research data obtained from the ELN protocols allows for the representation of the retrospective provenance of research data in a machine-interpretable way. Research Object Crate (RO-Crate) bundles including these models enable researchers to easily share the research data including the corresponding documentation, but also to search and relate the experiment to each other.","2022-01-31","2024-01-17 06:43:50","2024-03-26 14:59:51","2024-01-17 06:43:50","4","","","13","","J Biomed Semantics","","","","","","","","en","","","","","PubMed Central","","12 citations (Crossref) [2024-03-26] PMID: 35101121 PMCID: PMC8802522 titleTranslation: 從電子實驗室筆記本中獲取基於結構的知識，用於研究資料來源記錄 abstractTranslation:  背景電子實驗室筆記本 (ELN) 用於記錄濕實驗室中的實驗和研究。 ELN 中的協議包含所執行步驟的詳細描述，包括理解程序和所提出的研究數據以及重現研究調查的必要資訊。本研究的目的是調查此類 ELN 協議是否可用於透過使用本體和連結資料方法來建立研究資料來源的語義文件。方法 基於生物醫學濕實驗室實驗的 ELN 協議，手動設計所提出的研究數據的回顧性來源模型，以機器可解釋的方式描述實驗的細節。此外，從這些結果中得出了一種從 ELN 協議獲取知識的自動化方法。這種基於結構的方法利用實驗描述中的結構（例如標題、表格和連結）將 ELN 協議轉換為語義知識表示。為了滿足可查找、可存取、可互通和可重複使用 (FAIR) 指導原則，創建了一個可立即發布的捆綁包，其中包含研究資料及其語義文件。結果雖然手動建模工作透過採用一種協議來作為概念證明，但基於自動化結構的方法展示了七個 ELN 協議的潛在泛化能力。對於每個協議，都會建立一個準備發布的包，並透過使用 SPARQL 查詢語言來說明可以回答有關流程和所獲得的研究資料的問題。結論 從 ELN 協議獲得的研究數據的語義文件允許以機器可解釋的方式表示研究數據的回顧性來源。包含這些模型的研究對象箱 (RO-Crate) 捆綁包使研究人員能夠輕鬆共享包括相應文件在內的研究數據，還可以搜尋實驗並將其相互關聯。","","C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\8N5LVXVE\Schröder et al. - 2022 - Structure-based knowledge acquisition from electro.pdf; ","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8802522/","重要; 略讀; ELN; 實驗流程","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Querying KGs is critical in web search, question answering (QA), semantic search, personal assistants, fact checking, and recommendation. While significant progress has been made on KG construction and curation, thanks to deep learning recently we have seen a surge of research on KG querying and QA. The objectives of our survey are two-fold. First, research on KG querying has been conducted by several communities, such as databases, data mining, semantic web, machine learning, information retrieval, and natural language processing (NLP), with different focus and terminologies; and also in diverse topics ranging from graph databases, query languages, join algorithms, graph patterns matching, to more sophisticated KG embedding and natural language questions (NLQs). We aim at uniting different interdisciplinary topics and concepts that have been developed for KG querying. Second, many recent advances on KG and query embedding, multimodal KG, and KG-QA come from deep learning, IR, NLP, and computer vision domains. We identify important challenges of KG querying that received less attention by graph databases, and by the DB community in general, e.g., incomplete KG, semantic matching, multimodal data, and NLQs. We conclude by discussing interesting opportunities for the data management community, for instance, KG as a unified data model and vector-based query processing. © 2023 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).","2023","2024-01-15 00:22:45","2024-03-26 14:59:59","","18-29","","2","52","","","","","","","","","","en","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","1 citations (Crossref) [2024-03-26]","","C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\7YKCCV8J\Khan - 2023 - Knowledge Graphs Querying.pdf; C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\RJWRVKEK\display.html; C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\6Q47URGC\Khan - 2023 - Knowledge Graphs Querying.pdf","","未整理; 知識圖譜","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, finding answers to API-related questions from API documentation might not be easy because one may have to manually go through multiple pages before reaching the relevant page, and then read and understand the information inside the relevant page to figure out the answers. To deal with this challenge, we develop APIBot, a bot that can answer API questions given API documentation as an input. APIBot is built on top of SiriusQA, the QA system from Sirius, a state of the art intelligent personal assistant. To make SiriusQA work well under software engineering scenario, we make several modifications over SiriusQA by injecting domain specific knowledge.

The proposed approach enables the acquisition of new insights from the data by exploiting existing relationships between diverse types of datasets acquired through various modalities. The value of data consistently improves when it can be linked to other data because linking multiple types of datasets allows creating novel data patterns within a scientific data space. These patterns enable the exploratory data analysis, an analysis strategy that emphasizes incremental and adaptive access to the datasets constituting a scientific data space while maintaining an open mind to alternative possibilities of data interconnectivity. A technology, the Linked Open data (LOD), was developed to enable the linking of datasets.

Decision making tools based on artificial intelligence can help general practitioners diagnose diseases, but most existing research is not sufficiently scalable and explainable. An explainable and personalized cognitive reasoning model based on knowledge graph (CRKG) proposed in this paper can provide personalized diagnosis, perform decision making in general practice, and simulate the mode of thinking of human beings utilizing patients' electronic health records (EHRs) and knowledge graph. Taking abdominal diseases as the application point, an abdominal disease knowledge graph is first constructed in a semiautomated manner. Then, the CRKG designed referring to dual process theory in cognitive science involves the update strategy of global graph representations and reasoning on a personal cognitive graph by adopting the idea of graph neural networks and attention mechanisms. For the diagnosis of diseases in general practice, the CRKG outperforms all the baselines with a precision@1 of 0.7873, recall@10 of 0.9020 and hits@10 of 0.9340. Additionally, the visualization of the reasoning process for each visit of a patient based on the knowledge graph enhances clinicians' comprehension and contributes to explainability.

The ability of an organization to manage its organizational knowledge, specifically in the context of knowledge sharing, may enhance the organization’s overall performance. Various approaches and technologies have been introduced to assist the process in achieving that target. Ontology as one of the knowledge representation methods has been becoming popular to assist knowledge sharing in the organization. Previous reviews have mainly focused on general KM issues, with little emphasis on the use of ontology in knowledge sharing. Thus, this article reviews several ontology-based KM tools that can support knowledge-sharing activities to provide some insight into future research in this area. Thirteen ontology-based KM tools were reviewed using ten elements’ comparison criteria: the motivation, domain, source of knowledge, type of knowledge, knowledge extraction, knowledge input process, knowledge retrieval process, knowledge sharing technology, source of ontology component, and ontology methodology. The review found that several elements can be further studied to improve KM implementation in the organization, especially on the knowledge sharing dimension. This includes simplifying the knowledge extraction and retrieval process to explore various knowledge domains from implicit knowledge sources. The review’s outcome also includes proposed components and functions of an ideal ontology-based KM tool.","2022","2024-01-17 11:46:16","2024-03-26 14:59:44","2024-01-17 11:46:16","43267-43283","","","10","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","9 citations (Crossref) [2024-03-26] Conference Name: IEEE Access titleTranslation: 基於本體的組織知識分享知識管理工具—綜述","","C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\JDU9UD45\9745581.html; C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\AVJKLQ5T\Osman 等。 - 2022 - Ontology-Based Knowledge Management Tools for Know.pdf","","未整理; 知識圖譜","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Logs created by intrusion detection systems, Web servers, antivirus and anti-malware systems, firewalls and network devices have information that can reconstruct the activities of malware or a malicious agent, help plan for remediation and prevent attacks by revealing probes or intrusions before damage has been done. While existing tools like Splunk can help analyze logs with known schemas, understanding log whose format is unfamiliar or associated with new device or custom application can be challenging. We describe a framework for analyzing logs and automatically generating a semantic description of their schema and content in RDF. The framework begins by normalizing the log into columns and rows using regular expression-based and dictionary-based classifiers. Leveraging our existing work on inferring the semantics of tables, we associate semantic types with columns and, when possible, map them to concepts in general knowledge-bases (e.g. DBpedia) and domain specific ones (e.g., Unified Cybersecurity Ontology). We link cell values to known type instances (e.g., an IP address) and suggest relationships between columns.

The package encompasses a core ontology processing module founded on the widely-recognised and reliable OWL API, encapsulating its fundamental features in a more ""Pythonic"" manner and extending its capabilities to include other essential components including reasoning, verbalisation, normalisation, projection, and more. Building on this module, Deeponto offers a suite of tools, resources, and algorithms that support various ontology engineering tasks, such as ontology alignment and completion, by harnessing deep learning methodologies, primarily pre-trained LMs. In this paper, we also demonstrate the practical utility of Deeponto through two use-cases: the Digital Health Coaching in Samsung Research UK and the Bio-ML track of the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI).","2023-07-06","2024-01-30 05:13:08","2024-04-27 12:22:36","2024-01-30 05:13:08","","","","","","","DeepOnto","","","","","arXiv","","en","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv:2307.03067 [cs] titleTranslation: DeepOnto：用於深度學習本體工程的 Python 套件 abstractTranslation:  在本體工程中應用深度學習技術，特別是語言模型（LM）引起了廣泛的關注。然而，PyTorch 和 Tensorflow 等深度學習框架主要是為 Python 程式設計而開發的，而廣泛使用的本體 API（如 OWL API 和 Jena）主要基於 Java。為了促進這些框架和 API 的無縫集成，我們推出了 Deeponto，一個專為本體工程設計的 Python 套件。該軟體包包含一個基於廣泛認可且可靠的OWL API 的核心本體處理模組，以更「Pythonic」的方式封裝其基本功能，並擴展其功能以包含其他基本組件，包括推理、語言化、規範化、投影等。在此模組的基礎上，Deeponto 提供了一套工具、資源和演算法，透過利用深度學習方法（主要是預先訓練的 LM）來支援各種本體工程任務，例如本體對齊和完成。在本文中，我們還透過兩個用例展示了 Deeponto 的實用性：英國三星研究院的數位健康輔導和本體對齊評估計劃 (OAEI) 的生物機器學習軌道。","","C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\73KUPR9A\He et al. - 2023 - DeepOnto A Python Package for Ontology Engineerin.pdf; C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\F645KCS5\2307.html","","機器學習; 重要; 知識本體; LLM; 已整理","Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science - Computation and Language; Computer Science - Machine Learning; Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2307.03067","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, such internalized knowledge might be insufficient and incorrect, which could lead LLMs to generate factually wrong answers. Furthermore, fine-tuning LLMs to update their knowledge is expensive. To this end, we propose to augment the knowledge directly in the input of LLMs. Specifically, we first retrieve the relevant facts to the input question from the knowledge graph based on semantic similarities between the question and its associated facts. After that, we prepend the retrieved facts to the input question in the form of the prompt, which is then forwarded to LLMs to generate the answer. Our framework, Knowledge-Augmented language model PromptING (KAPING), requires no model training, thus completely zero-shot.

However, their application to long audio transcription via buffered or sliding window approaches is prone to drifting, hallucination & repetition; and prohibits batched transcription due to their sequential nature. Further, timestamps corresponding each utterance are prone to inaccuracies and word-level timestamps are not available out-of-the-box. To overcome these challenges, we present WhisperX, a time-accurate speech recognition system with word-level timestamps utilising voice activity detection and forced phoneme alignment. In doing so, we demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on long-form transcription and word segmentation benchmarks. Additionally, we show that pre-segmenting audio with our proposed VAD Cut & Merge strategy improves transcription quality and enables a twelve-fold transcription speedup via batched inference.","2023-07-11","2024-02-23 11:10:00","2024-03-14 03:59:51","2024-02-23 11:10:00","","","","","","","WhisperX","","","","","arXiv","","en","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv:2303.00747 [cs, eess] titleTranslation: WhisperX：長格式音訊的時間精確語音轉錄","","C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\H3K8JY2G\Bain 等。 - 2023 - WhisperX Time-Accurate Speech Transcription of Lo.pdf; C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\HN3GR3S5\2303.html","","重要; 已整理; 語音辨識; 文獻; Whisper","Computer Science - Sound; Electrical Engineering and Systems Science - Audio and Speech Processing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2303.00747","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The first contact with the chatbot reveals its ability to provide detailed and precise answers in various areas. Several publications on ChatGPT evaluation test its effectiveness on well-known natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, the existing studies are mostly non-automated and tested on a very limited scale. In this work, we examined ChatGPT’s capabilities on 25 diverse analytical NLP tasks, most of them subjective even to humans, such as sentiment analysis, emotion recognition, offensiveness, and stance detection. In contrast, the other tasks require more objective reasoning like word sense disambiguation, linguistic acceptability, and question answering. We also evaluated GPT-4 model on five selected subsets of NLP tasks. We automated ChatGPT and GPT-4 prompting process and analyzed more than 49k responses. Our comparison of its results with available State-of-the-Art (SOTA) solutions showed that the average loss in quality of the ChatGPT model was about 25% for zero-shot and few-shot evaluation. For GPT-4 model, a loss for semantic tasks is significantly lower than for ChatGPT. We showed that the more difficult the task (lower SOTA performance), the higher the ChatGPT loss. It especially refers to pragmatic NLP problems like emotion recognition. We also tested the ability to personalize ChatGPT responses for selected subjective tasks via Random Contextual Few-Shot Personalization, and we obtained significantly better user-based predictions. Additional qualitative analysis revealed a ChatGPT bias, most likely due to the rules imposed on human trainers by OpenAI. Our results provide the basis for a fundamental discussion of whether the high quality of recent predictive NLP models can indicate a tool’s usefulness to society and how the learning and validation procedures for such systems should be established.","2023-11-01","2024-02-24 01:46:04","2024-03-26 14:59:36","2024-02-24 01:46:04","101861","","","99","","Information Fusion","ChatGPT","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","55 citations (Crossref) [2024-03-26] titleTranslation: ChatGPT：萬事通，一無是處","","C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\T393E7E9\Kocoń 等。 - 2023 - ChatGPT Jack of all trades, master of none.pdf; C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\JHGC2FD6\S156625352300177X.html","","重要; ChatGPT; 已整理","Text classification; Large language model; Emotion recognition; GPT-4; Humor detection; Model personalization; Natural language inference (NLI); Natural language processing (NLP); Offensive content; Pragmatic NLP tasks; Prompting; Question answering (QA); Semantic NLP tasks; Sentiment analysis; SOTA analysis; Stance detection; Subjective NLP tasks; Word sense disambiguation (WSD)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the use of ChatGPT in academic settings is a controversial issue, leading to a severe concern about academic integrity and AI-assisted cheating, while scholarly communities still lack clear principles on using such innovation in academia. Accordingly, this study aims to understand the motivations driving academics and researchers to use ChatGPT in their work, and specifically the role of academic integrity in making up adoption behavior. Based on 702 responses retrieved from users of ResearchGate and Academia.edu, we found that ChatGPT usage is positively shaped by time-saving feature, e-word of mouth, academic self-efficacy, academic self-esteem, and perceived stress. In contrast, peer influence and academic integrity had a negative effect on usage. Intriguingly, academic integrity-moderated interactions of time-saving, self-esteem and perceived stress on ChatGPT usage are found to be significantly positive. Therefore, we suggest that stakeholders, including academic institutions, publishers and AI language models' programmers, should work together to specify necessary guidelines for the ethical use of AI chatbots in academic work and research.","2023-11-01","2024-02-24 02:32:15","2024-04-26 09:37:07","2024-02-24 02:32:15","102370","","","75","","Technology in Society","Use of ChatGPT in academia","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","17 citations (Crossref) [2024-03-26] titleTranslation: ChatGPT 在學術界的使用：學術誠信懸而未決","","D:\Paper\Use of ChatGPT in academia- Academic integrity hangs in the balance.pdf","","使用者研究; 已整理; 研究流程","ChatGPT; Artificial intelligence; Academia; Academic integrity; Plagiarism; Technology adoption","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is unclear whether state-of-the-art embeddings on semantic textual similarity (STS) can be equally well applied to other tasks like clustering or reranking. This makes progress in the field difficult to track, as various models are constantly being proposed without proper evaluation. To solve this problem, we introduce the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB). MTEB spans 8 embedding tasks covering a total of 58 datasets and 112 languages. Through the benchmarking of 33 models on MTEB, we establish the most comprehensive benchmark of text embeddings to date. We find that no particular text embedding method dominates across all tasks. This suggests that the field has yet to converge on a universal text embedding method and scale it up sufficiently to provide state-of-the-art results on all embedding tasks.

We leverage a careful selection of 18 publicly available datasets from diverse text retrieval tasks and domains and evaluate 10 state-of-the-art retrieval systems including lexical, sparse, dense, late-interaction and re-ranking architectures on the BEIR benchmark. Our results show BM25 is a robust baseline and re-ranking and late-interaction-based models on average achieve the best zero-shot performances, however, at high computational costs. In contrast, dense and sparse-retrieval models are computationally more efficient but often underperform other approaches, highlighting the considerable room for improvement in their generalization capabilities.

An important application area is question answering over private enterprise documents where the main considerations are data security, which necessitates applications that can be deployed on-prem, limited computational resources and the need for a robust application that correctly responds to queries. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as the most prominent framework for building LLM-based applications. While building a RAG is relatively straightforward, making it robust and a reliable application requires extensive customization and relatively deep knowledge of the application domain. We share our experiences building and deploying an LLM application for question answering over private organizational documents. Our application combines the use of RAG with a finetuned open-source LLM. Additionally, our system, which we call Tree-RAG (T-RAG), uses a tree structure to represent entity hierarchies within the organization. This is used to generate a textual description to augment the context when responding to user queries pertaining to entities within the organization's hierarchy. Our evaluations show that this combination performs better than a simple RAG or finetuning implementation.

Methods: We developed an LLM-RAG model using 35 preoperative guidelines and tested it against human-generated responses, with a total of 1260 responses evaluated. The RAG process involved converting clinical documents into text using Python-based frameworks like LangChain and Llamaindex, and processing these texts into chunks for embedding and retrieval. Vector storage techniques and selected embedding models to optimize data retrieval, using Pinecone for vector storage with a dimensionality of 1536 and cosine similarity for loss metrics.

In this paper we study, from a theoretical perspective, the widely used Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG)-type ranking measures. Although there are extensive empirical studies of NDCG, little is known about its theoretical properties. We first show that, whatever the ranking function is, the standard NDCG which adopts a logarithmic discount, converges to 1 as the number of items to rank goes to infinity. On the first sight, this result is very surprising. It seems to imply that NDCG cannot differentiate good and bad ranking functions, contradicting to the empirical success of NDCG in many applications. In order to have a deeper understanding of ranking measures in general, we propose a notion referred to as consistent distinguishability. This notion captures the intuition that a ranking measure should have such a property: For every pair of substantially different ranking functions, the ranking measure can decide which one is better in a consistent manner on almost all datasets. We show that NDCG with logarithmic discount has consistent distinguishability although it converges to the same limit for all ranking functions. We next characterize the set of all feasible discount functions for NDCG according to the concept of consistent distinguishability. Specifically we show that whether NDCG has consistent distinguishability depends on how fast the discount decays, and 1/r is a critical point. We then turn to the cut-off version of NDCG, i.e., NDCG@k. We analyze the distinguishability of NDCG@k for various choices of k and the discount functions. Experimental results on real Web search datasets agree well with the theory.","2013-04-24","2024-03-13 18:45:16","2024-03-14 03:59:27","2024-03-13 18:45:16","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv","","en","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv:1304.6480 [cs, stat] titleTranslation: NDCG類型排序指標的理論分析","","C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\ZUHKHYJJ\Wang 等。 - 2013 - A Theoretical Analysis of NDCG Type Ranking Measur.pdf; C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\8MDUUQ8C\1304.html","","機器學習; 已整理; 問答系統; 基礎理論; 排序任務; 評估","Computer Science - Information Retrieval","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:1304.6480","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, this overlooks the fact that there are many diverse and unique retrieval tasks, each targeting different search intents, queries, and search domains. In this paper, we suggest to work on Few-shot Dense Retrieval, a setting where each task comes with a short description and a few examples. To amplify the power of a few examples, we propose Prompt-base Query Generation for Retriever (Promptagator), which leverages large language models (LLM) as a few-shot query generator, and creates task-specific retrievers based on the generated data. Powered by LLM's generalization ability, Promptagator makes it possible to create task-specific end-to-end retrievers solely based on a few examples {without} using Natural Questions or MS MARCO to train %question generators or dual encoders. Surprisingly, LLM prompting with no more than 8 examples allows dual encoders to outperform heavily engineered models trained on MS MARCO like ColBERT v2 by more than 1.2 nDCG on average on 11 retrieval sets. Further training standard-size re-rankers using the same generated data yields another 5.0 point nDCG improvement.

However, they require large amounts of training data which is not available for most domains. As shown in previous work (Thakur et al., 2021b), the performance of dense retrievers severely degrades under a domain shift. This limits the usage of dense retrieval approaches to only a few domains with large training datasets. In this paper, we propose the novel unsupervised domain adaptation method Generative Pseudo Labeling (GPL), which combines a query generator with pseudo labeling from a cross-encoder. On six representative domain-specialized datasets, we find the proposed GPL can outperform an out-of-the-box state-of-the-art dense retrieval approach by up to 9.3 points nDCG@10. GPL requires less (unlabeled) data from the target domain and is more robust in its training than previous methods.

We present a multi-hop reasoning dataset, Question Answering via Sentence Composition(QASC), that requires retrieving facts from a large corpus and composing them to answer a multiple-choice question. QASC is the first dataset to offer two desirable properties: (a) the facts to be composed are annotated in a large corpus, and (b) the decomposition into these facts is not evident from the question itself. The latter makes retrieval challenging as the system must introduce new concepts or relations in order to discover potential decompositions. Further, the reasoning model must then learn to identify valid compositions of these retrieved facts using common-sense reasoning. To help address these challenges, we provide annotation for supporting facts as well as their composition. Guided by these annotations, we present a two-step approach to mitigate the retrieval challenges. We use other multiple-choice datasets as additional training data to strengthen the reasoning model.

Additionally, providing provenance for their decisions and updating their world knowledge remain open research problems. Pre-trained models with a differentiable access mechanism to explicit non-parametric memory can overcome this issue, but have so far been only investigated for extractive downstream tasks. We explore a general-purpose fine-tuning recipe for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) -- models which combine pre-trained parametric and non-parametric memory for language generation. We introduce RAG models where the parametric memory is a pre-trained seq2seq model and the non-parametric memory is a dense vector index of Wikipedia, accessed with a pre-trained neural retriever. We compare two RAG formulations, one which conditions on the same retrieved passages across the whole generated sequence, the other can use different passages per token. We fine-tune and evaluate our models on a wide range of knowledge-intensive NLP tasks and set the state-of-the-art on three open domain QA tasks, outperforming parametric seq2seq models and task-specific retrieve-and-extract architectures.

Computational notebooks have emerged as a particularly effective medium for sharing and reusing scientific codes. Nevertheless, effectively locating relevant computational notebooks is a significant challenge. First, computational notebooks encompass multi-modal data comprising unstructured text, source code, and other media, posing complexities in representing such data for retrieval purposes. Second, the absence of evaluation datasets for the computational notebook search task hampers fair performance assessments within the research community. Prior studies have either treated computational notebook search as a code-snippet search problem or focused solely on content-based approaches for searching computational notebooks. To address the aforementioned difficulties, we present DeCNR, tackling the information needs of researchers in seeking computational notebooks. Our approach leverages a fused sparse-dense retrieval model to represent computational notebooks effectively. Additionally, we construct an evaluation dataset including actual scientific queries, computational notebooks, and relevance judgments for fair and objective performance assessment. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses baseline approaches in terms of F1@5 and NDCG@5. The proposed system has been implemented as a web service shipped with REST APIs, allowing seamless integration with other applications and web services.","2023-10","2024-03-22 00:02:12","2024-04-26 09:51:43","2024-03-22 00:02:12","1-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","0 citations (Crossref) [2024-03-26] ISSN: 2325-3703 titleTranslation: 科學計算筆記本的密集檢索系統和評估資料集","","C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\R6CLDIM6\Li 等。 - 2023 - A Dense Retrieval System and Evaluation Dataset fo.pdf; C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\SBPRM4XS\10254859.html","","未整理; 資料集; 程式碼分析; RAG","Codes; Source coding; Web services; Complexity theory; Computational modeling; computational notebook search; evaluation dataset; Jupyter Notebook; Media; scientific code reuse; Search problems; virtual research environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2023 IEEE 19th International Conference on e-Science (e-Science)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Design/methodology/approach We re-annotate, a second time, the contributions-pertinent information across 50 prior-annotated NLP scholarly articles in terms of a data pipeline comprising: contribution-centered sentences, phrases, and triple statements. To this end, specifically, care was taken in the adjudication annotation stage to reduce annotation noise while formulating the guidelines for our proposed novel NLP contributions structuring and graphing scheme. Findings The application of NlpContributionGraph on the 50 articles resulted finally in a dataset of 900 contribution-focused sentences, 4,702 contribution-information-centered phrases, and 2,980 surface-structured triples. The intra-annotation agreement between the first and second stages, in terms of F1-score, was 67.92% for sentences, 41.82% for phrases, and 22.31% for triple statements indicating that with increased granularity of the information, the annotation decision variance is greater. Research limitations NlpContributionGraph has limited scope for structuring scholarly contributions compared with STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Medicine) scholarly knowledge at large. Further, the annotation scheme in this work is designed by only an intra-annotator consensus—a single annotator first annotated the data to propose the initial scheme, following which, the same annotator reannotated the data to normalize the annotations in an adjudication stage. However, the expected goal of this work is to achieve a standardized retrospective model of capturing NLP contributions from scholarly articles. This would entail a larger initiative of enlisting multiple annotators to accommodate different worldviews into a “single” set of structures and relationships as the final scheme. Given that the initial scheme is first proposed and the complexity of the annotation task in the realistic timeframe, our intra-annotation procedure is well-suited. Nevertheless, the model proposed in this work is presently limited since it does not incorporate multiple annotator worldviews. This is planned as future work to produce a robust model. Practical implications We demonstrate NlpContributionGraph data integrated into the Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG), a next-generation KG-based digital library with intelligent computations enabled over structured scholarly knowledge, as a viable aid to assist researchers in their day-to-day tasks. Originality/value NlpContributionGraph is a novel scheme to annotate research contributions from NLP articles and integrate them in a knowledge graph, which to the best of our knowledge does not exist in the community. Furthermore, our quantitative evaluations over the two-stage annotation tasks offer insights into task difficulty.","2021-06-01","2024-03-25 06:18:37","2024-03-28 05:10:51","2024-03-25 06:18:37","6-34","","3","6","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","sciendo.com","","5 citations (Crossref) [2024-03-26] titleTranslation: 用於建構自然語言處理貢獻知識圖的句子、片語和三重註釋——試驗資料集","","C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\GXSE4ERQ\D’Souza 與 Auer - 2021 - Sentence, Phrase, and Triple Annotations to Build .pdf","","未整理; 資料集; 知識圖譜; NLP","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Scholarly knowledge graphs can be used to organize the scholarly knowledge presented within those publications and represent them in machine-readable formats. Natural language processing (NLP) provides scalable methods to automatically extract knowledge from articles and populate scholarly knowledge graphs. However, NLP extraction is generally not sufficiently accurate and, thus, fails to generate high granularity quality data. In this work, we present TinyGenius, a methodology to validate NLP-extracted scholarly knowledge statements using microtasks performed with crowdsourcing. TinyGenius is employed to populate a paper-centric knowledge graph, using five distinct NLP methods. We extend our previous work of the TinyGenius methodology in various ways. Specifically, we discuss the NLP tasks in more detail and include an explanation of the data model. Moreover, we present a user evaluation where participants validate the generated NLP statements.

The “Reproducibility Crisis”, where researchers find difficulty in reproducing published results, is currently faced by several disciplines. To understand the underlying problem in the context of the reproducibility crisis, it is important to first know the different research practices followed in their domain and the factors that hinder reproducibility. We performed an exploratory study by conducting a survey addressed to researchers representing a range of disciplines to understand scientific experiments and research practices for reproducibility. The survey findings identify a reproducibility crisis and a strong need for sharing data, code, methods, steps, and negative and positive results. Insufficient metadata, lack of publicly available data, and incomplete information in study methods are considered to be the main reasons for poor reproducibility. The survey results also address a wide number of research questions on the reproducibility of scientific results.

Furthermore, it intended to identify the most effective methods utilized in the design of QAS. The systematic review of literature research method was selected as the most appropriate methodology for studying the research topic. This method differs from the conventional literature review as it is more comprehensive and objective. Based on the findings, QAS is a highly active area of research, with scholars taking diverse approaches in the development of their systems. Some of the limitations observed in these studies encompass the focused nature of current QAS, weaknesses associated with models that are used as building blocks for QAS, the need for standard datasets and question formats hence limiting the applicability of the QAS in practical settings, and the failure of researchers to examine their QAS solutions comprehensively. The most effective methods for designing QAS include focusing on syntax and context, utilizing word encoding and knowledge systems, leveraging deep learning, and using elements such as machine learning and artificial intelligence.

In this paper, we recognize the difficulty of zero-shot learning and encoding relevance. Instead, we propose to pivot through Hypothetical Document Embeddings~(HyDE). Given a query, HyDE first zero-shot instructs an instruction-following language model (e.g. InstructGPT) to generate a hypothetical document. The document captures relevance patterns but is unreal and may contain false details. Then, an unsupervised contrastively learned encoder~(e.g. Contriever) encodes the document into an embedding vector. This vector identifies a neighborhood in the corpus embedding space, where similar real documents are retrieved based on vector similarity. This second step ground the generated document to the actual corpus, with the encoder's dense bottleneck filtering out the incorrect details.

The need for such systems is higher in the context of the Arabic language. This is because of the scarcity of Arabic QA systems, which can be attributed to the great challenges they present to the research commu nity, including the particularities of Arabic, such as short vowels, absence of capital letters, c omplex morphology, etc. In this paper, we report the design and implementation of an Arabic w eb-based question answering system, which we called “JAWEB”, the Arabic word for the verb “an swer”. Unlike all Arabic question- answering systems, JAWEB is a web-based application , so it can be accessed at any time and from anywhere. Evaluating JAWEB showed when compare d to ask.com, the well-established web-based QA system, JAWEB provided 15-20% higher r ecall. These promising results give clear evidence that JAWEB has great potential as a QA platform and is much needed by Arabic- speaking Internet users across the world.","2014-02-21","2024-04-06 07:52:24","2024-04-09 09:32:53","","187-202","","","4","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ResearchGate","","titleTranslation: 基於網路的阿拉伯語問答系統的發展和評估 abstractTranslation:  由於網路內容量的不斷增加以及常規資訊檢索技術無法滿足的對數位資訊的高需求，問答（QA）系統變得越來越重要。問答系統使用戶能夠與機器進行自然語言對話，這幾乎是網路上所有新興線上服務系統所必需的。在阿拉伯語環境中，對此類系統的需求更高。這是因為阿拉伯語問答系統的稀缺性，這可以歸因於它們給研究界帶來了巨大的挑戰，包括阿拉伯語的特殊性，如短元音、缺乏大寫字母、複雜的形態等。在本文中，我們報告了一個基於阿拉伯語網絡的問答系統的設計和實現，我們稱之為“JAWEB”，阿拉伯語中動詞“an swer”的意思。與所有阿拉伯語問答系統不同，JAWEB 是一個基於網路的應用程序，因此可以隨時隨地存取。對 JAWEB 的評估表明，與完善的基於網路的 QA 系統 Ask.com 相比，JAWEB 的召回率提高了 15-20%。這些令人鼓舞的結果清楚地表明，JAWEB 作為 QA 平台具有巨大潛力，並且是世界各地阿拉伯語網路使用者的迫切需求。","","C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\VI4IV4B9\Kurdi 等。 - 2014 - Development and Evaluation of a Web Based Question.pdf; ","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269238993_Development_and_Evaluation_of_a_Web_Based_Question_Answering_System_for_Arabic_Language","未整理; 問答系統","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science & Information Technology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the reliability of the retrieved information is not always guaranteed. The retrieval of irrelevant data can lead to misguided responses, and potentially causing the model to overlook its inherent knowledge, even when it possesses adequate information to address the query. Moreover, standard RALMs often struggle to assess whether they possess adequate knowledge, both intrinsic and retrieved, to provide an accurate answer. In situations where knowledge is lacking, these systems should ideally respond with ""unknown"" when the answer is unattainable. In response to these challenges, we introduces Chain-of-Noting (CoN), a novel approach aimed at improving the robustness of RALMs in facing noisy, irrelevant documents and in handling unknown scenarios. The core idea of CoN is to generate sequential reading notes for retrieved documents, enabling a thorough evaluation of their relevance to the given question and integrating this information to formulate the final answer. We employed ChatGPT to create training data for CoN, which was subsequently trained on an LLaMa-2 7B model. Our experiments across four open-domain QA benchmarks show that RALMs equipped with CoN significantly outperform standard RALMs. Notably, CoN achieves an average improvement of +7.9 in EM score given entirely noisy retrieved documents and +10.5 in rejection rates for real-time questions that fall outside the pre-training knowledge scope.","2023-11-15","2024-04-10 09:24:17","2024-04-26 09:28:54","2024-04-10 09:24:17","","","","","","","Chain-of-Note","","","","","arXiv","","en","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv:2311.09210 [cs] abstractTranslation:  檢索增強語言模型（RALM）代表了大型語言模型能力的重大進步，特別是在透過利用外部知識來源來減少事實幻覺方面。然而，檢索到的信息的可靠性並不總是得到保證。檢索不相關的資料可能會導致錯誤的回應，並可能導致模型忽略其固有知識，即使它擁有足夠的資訊來解決查詢。此外，標準 RALM 經常難以評估它們是否擁有足夠的知識（內在的和檢索到的）以提供準確的答案。在缺乏知識的情況下，當答案無法獲得時，這些系統理想地應該回應「未知」。為了應對這些挑戰，我們引入了 Chain-of-Noting (CoN)，這是一種新穎的方法，旨在提高 RALM 在面對嘈雜、不相關的文件和處理未知場景時的穩健性。 CoN 的核心思想是為檢索到的文件生成順序閱讀筆記，從而能夠全面評估它們與給定問題的相關性，並整合這些資訊以製定最終答案。我們使用 ChatGPT 為 CoN 建立訓練數據，然後在 LLaMa-2 7B 模型上進行訓練。我們在四個開放域 QA 基準測試中進行的實驗表明，配備 CoN 的 RALM 的性能顯著優於標準 RALM。值得注意的是，在完全吵雜的檢索文件的情況下，CoN 的 EM 分數平均提高了 +7.9，而對於超出預訓練知識範圍的即時問題，CoN 的拒絕率平均提高了 +10.5。 titleTranslation: Chain-of-Note：增強檢索增強語言模型的穩健性","","C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\C83G7T8L\Yu 等。 - 2023 - Chain-of-Note Enhancing Robustness in Retrieval-A.pdf; C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\SIY7RCBG\2311.html","","LLM; 已整理; 問答系統; 微讀; RAG; RALM","Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science - Computation and Language","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2311.09210","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This method addresses common LLM limitations, including outdated information and the tendency to produce inaccurate ""hallucinated"" content. However, the evaluation of RAG systems is challenging, as existing benchmarks are limited in scope and diversity. Most of the current benchmarks predominantly assess question-answering applications, overlooking the broader spectrum of situations where RAG could prove advantageous. Moreover, they only evaluate the performance of the LLM component of the RAG pipeline in the experiments, and neglect the influence of the retrieval component and the external knowledge database. To address these issues, this paper constructs a large-scale and more comprehensive benchmark, and evaluates all the components of RAG systems in various RAG application scenarios. Specifically, we have categorized the range of RAG applications into four distinct types-Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD), each representing a unique use case. ""Create"" refers to scenarios requiring the generation of original, varied content. ""Read"" involves responding to intricate questions in knowledge-intensive situations. ""Update"" focuses on revising and rectifying inaccuracies or inconsistencies in pre-existing texts. ""Delete"" pertains to the task of summarizing extensive texts into more concise forms. For each of these CRUD categories, we have developed comprehensive datasets to evaluate the performance of RAG systems. We also analyze the effects of various components of the RAG system, such as the retriever, the context length, the knowledge base construction, and the LLM.

To alleviate this issue, we propose a framework called Knowledge-Driven Chain-of-Thought (KD-CoT) to verify and modify reasoning traces in CoT via interaction with external knowledge, and thus overcome the hallucinations and error propagation. Concretely, we formulate the CoT rationale process of LLMs into a structured multi-round QA format.

However, the personalization issue still remains a much-coveted property, especially when it comes to the multiple sources involved in the dialogue system. To better plan and incorporate the use of multiple sources in generating personalized response, we firstly decompose it into three sub-tasks: Knowledge Source Selection, Knowledge Retrieval, and Response Generation. We then propose a novel Unified Multi-Source Retrieval-Augmented Generation system (UniMS-RAG) Specifically, we unify these three sub-tasks with different formulations into the same sequence-to-sequence paradigm during the training, to adaptively retrieve evidences and evaluate the relevance on-demand using special tokens, called acting tokens and evaluation tokens. Enabling language models to generate acting tokens facilitates interaction with various knowledge sources, allowing them to adapt their behavior to diverse task requirements. Meanwhile, evaluation tokens gauge the relevance score between the dialogue context and the retrieved evidence.

However, with their widespread deployment, there is a general lack of research that thoroughly discusses and analyzes the potential risks concealed. In that case, we intend to conduct a preliminary but pioneering study covering the robustness, consistency, and credibility of LLMs systems. With most of the related literature in the era of LLM uncharted, we propose an automated workflow that copes with an upscaled number of queries/responses. Overall, we conduct over a million queries to the mainstream LLMs including ChatGPT, LLaMA, and OPT. Core to our workflow consists of a data primitive, followed by an automated interpreter that evaluates these LLMs under different adversarial metrical systems. As a result, we draw several, and perhaps unfortunate, conclusions that are quite uncommon from this trendy community. Briefly, they are: (i)-the minor but inevitable error occurrence in the user-generated query input may, by chance, cause the LLM to respond unexpectedly; (ii)-LLMs possess poor consistency when processing semantically similar query input. In addition, as a side finding, we find that ChatGPT is still capable to yield the correct answer even when the input is polluted at an extreme level. While this phenomenon demonstrates the powerful memorization of the LLMs, it raises serious concerns about using such data for LLM-involved evaluation in academic development. To deal with it, we propose a novel index associated with a dataset that roughly decides the feasibility of using such data for LLM-involved evaluation. Extensive empirical studies are tagged to support the aforementioned claims.","2023-05-15","2024-04-16 01:09:17","2024-04-18 01:25:17","2024-04-16 01:09:17","","","","","","","Assessing Hidden Risks of LLMs","","","","","","","en","","","","","typeset.io","","Publisher: arXiv (Cornell University) titleTranslation: 評估法學碩士的隱藏風險：穩健性、一致性和可信度的實證研究 abstractTranslation:  最近流行的大型語言模型（LLM）為無限的領域帶來了重大影響，特別是透過其開放式生態系統，如 API、開源模型和插件。然而，隨著其廣泛部署，普遍缺乏對其隱藏的潛在風險進行深入討論和分析的研究。在這種情況下，我們打算進行一項初步但開創性的研究，涵蓋法學碩士系統的穩健性、一致性和可信度。鑑於法學碩士時代的大多數相關文獻都是未知的，我們提出了一種自動化工作流程，可以應對大量的查詢/回應。總體而言，我們對主流 LLM 進行了超過一百萬次查詢，包括 ChatGPT、LLaMA 和 OPT。我們工作流程的核心包括一個資料原語，然後是一個自動解釋器，該解釋器在不同的對抗性度量系統下評估這些法學碩士。結果，我們得出了幾個可能是不幸的結論，這些結論在這個時尚社群中是非常不常見的。簡而言之，它們是： (i)-使用者產生的查詢輸入中出現的輕微但不可避免的錯誤可能會偶然導致 LLM 意外回應； (ii)-LLM 在處理語意相似的查詢輸入時一致性較差。此外，作為一個側面發現，我們發現即使輸入受到極端程度的污染，ChatGPT 仍然能夠產生正確的答案。雖然這種現象證明了法學碩士的強大記憶力，但它引起了人們對將此類數據用於法學碩士涉及的學術發展評估的嚴重擔憂。為了解決這個問題，我們提出了一種與資料集相關的新穎索引，該索引粗略地決定了使用此類資料進行法學碩士相關評估的可行性。廣泛的實證研究被標記為支持上述主張。","","C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\QXVB7FSU\2023 - Assessing Hidden Risks of LLMs An Empirical Study.pdf","","未整理","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The LLM-Brain framework integrates multiple multimodal language models for robotic tasks, utilizing a zero-shot learning approach. All components within LLM-Brain communicate using natural language in closed-loop multi-round dialogues that encompass perception, planning, control, and memory. The core of the system is an embodied LLM to maintain egocentric memory and control the robot. We demonstrate LLM-Brain by examining two downstream tasks: active exploration and embodied question answering.

This is because the semantics-based model and linked data approach behind the digital twin, as the successor of classical BIM, provide strong capability in integrating data from fragmented and heterogeneous sources and thus enable better-informed decision-making. Taking buildings as the case, this paper demonstrates the ontology-based Information Management Framework and elaborates on the process to integrate data through a common data model. Specifically, the Foundation Data Model (FDM) representing the operation of buildings and embedded systems is developed and two patterns of integration architecture are compared. To conceptualise all the essential entities and relationships, the building topology ontology and BRICK ontology are reused and merged to serve as a feasible FDM.

We introduce Retrieval-Augmented Dual Instruction Tuning (RA-DIT), a lightweight fine-tuning methodology that provides a third option by retrofitting any LLM with retrieval capabilities. Our approach operates in two distinct fine-tuning steps: (1) one updates a pre-trained LM to better use retrieved information, while (2) the other updates the retriever to return more relevant results, as preferred by the LM. By fine-tuning over tasks that require both knowledge utilization and contextual awareness, we demonstrate that each stage yields significant performance improvements, and using both leads to additional gains.

For further evaluation, we curate a set of expert-written instructions for novel tasks, and show through human evaluation that tuning GPT3 with Self-Instruct outperforms using existing public instruction datasets by a large margin, leaving only a 5% absolute gap behind InstructGPT-001.

While typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method still requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of thousands of examples. By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language task from only a few examples or from simple instructions - something which current NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model, and test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model. GPT-3 achieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require on-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time, we also identify some datasets where GPT-3's few-shot learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to training on large web corpora. Finally, we find that GPT-3 can generate samples of news articles which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from articles written by humans.

While derivative-based algorithms have been powerful tools for various problems, the absence of gradient imposes challenges on many real-world applications. In this work, we propose Optimization by PROmpting (OPRO), a simple and effective approach to leverage large language models (LLMs) as optimizers, where the optimization task is described in natural language. In each optimization step, the LLM generates new solutions from the prompt that contains previously generated solutions with their values, then the new solutions are evaluated and added to the prompt for the next optimization step.

This issue of hallucination is arguably the biggest hindrance to safely deploying these powerful LLMs into real-world production systems that impact people's lives. The journey toward widespread adoption of LLMs in practical settings heavily relies on addressing and mitigating hallucinations. Unlike traditional AI systems focused on limited tasks, LLMs have been exposed to vast amounts of online text data during training. While this allows them to display impressive language fluency, it also means they are capable of extrapolating information from the biases in training data, misinterpreting ambiguous prompts, or modifying the information to align superficially with the input. This becomes hugely alarming when we rely on language generation capabilities for sensitive applications, such as summarizing medical records, financial analysis reports, etc. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of over 32 techniques developed to mitigate hallucination in LLMs. Notable among these are Retrieval Augmented Generation (Lewis et al, 2021), Knowledge Retrieval (Varshney et al,2023), CoNLI (Lei et al, 2023), and CoVe (Dhuliawala et al, 2023). Furthermore, we introduce a detailed taxonomy categorizing these methods based on various parameters, such as dataset utilization, common tasks, feedback mechanisms, and retriever types. This classification helps distinguish the diverse approaches specifically designed to tackle hallucination issues in LLMs. Additionally, we analyze the challenges and limitations inherent in these techniques, providing a solid foundation for future research in addressing hallucinations and related phenomena within the realm of LLMs.","2024-01-08","2024-04-28 12:05:16","2024-07-09 23:45:43","2024-04-28 12:05:16","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv","","en","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv:2401.01313 [cs] abstractTranslation:  隨著大型語言模型（LLM）在編寫類似人類文本的能力方面不斷進步，一個關鍵的挑戰仍然是它們傾向於產生看似事實但毫無根據的內容。這種幻覺問題可以說是將這些強大的法學碩士安全部署到影響人們生活的現實生產系統中的最大障礙。在實際環境中廣泛採用法學碩士的旅程在很大程度上依賴於解決和減輕幻覺。與專注於有限任務的傳統人工智慧系統不同，法學碩士在訓練期間接觸了大量線上文字資料。雖然這使他們能夠表現出令人印象深刻的語言流暢性，但這也意味著他們能夠從訓練數據的偏差中推斷出信息，誤解不明確的提示，或者修改信息以表面上與輸入保持一致。當我們依賴語言生成功能來實現敏感應用程式（例如總結醫療記錄、財務分析報告等）時，這就變得非常令人擔憂。全面調查。其中值得注意的是檢索增強生成（Lewis 等人，2021）、知識檢索（Varshney 等人，2023）、CoNLI（Lei 等人，2023）和 CoVe（Dhuliawala 等人，2023）。此外，我們引入了一個詳細的分類法，根據各種參數對這些方法進行分類，例如資料集利用率、常見任務、回饋機制和檢索器類型。這種分類有助於區分專門為解決法學碩士的幻覺問題而設計的不同方法。此外，我們分析了這些技術固有的挑戰和局限性，為法學碩士領域內解決幻覺和相關現象的未來研究奠定了堅實的基礎。 titleTranslation: 大型語言模型中幻覺緩解技術的綜合調查","","; false; C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\4G2YW78M\Tonmoy 等。 - 2024 - A Comprehensive Survey of Hallucination Mitigation.pdf; C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\ZURNS949\2401.html","https://imwangfu.com/2024/01/llm-illusion.html?locale=zh_TW; ","重要; 未整理; LLM; Survey; 幻覺; 文獻","Computer Science - Computation and Language","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2401.01313","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However traditional ML methods have limitations on generalizability (adapting to different scenarios) and inference ability (understanding the context). Fortunately, large language models (LLMs) have shown high generalizability and human-competitive abilities in understanding context, which are promising for data management tasks (e.g., database diagnosis, database tuning). However, existing LLMs have several limitations: hallucination, high cost, and low accuracy for complicated tasks. To address these challenges, we design LLMDB, an LLM-enhanced data management paradigm which has generalizability and high inference ability while avoiding hallucination, reducing LLM cost, and achieving high accuracy. LLMDB embeds domain-specific knowledge to avoid hallucination by LLM fine-tuning and prompt engineering. LLMDB reduces the high cost of LLMs by vector databases which provide semantic search and caching abilities. LLMDB improves the task accuracy by LLM agent which provides multiple-round inference and pipeline executions. We showcase three real-world scenarios that LLMDB can well support, including query rewrite, database diagnosis and data analytics.

Concerns about 'too much to read' have been expressed for many centuries, and made more urgent since the arrival of ubiquitous digital information in the late twentieth century. The historical perspective is a necessary corrective to the often, and wrongly, held view that it is associated solely with the modern digital information environment, and with social media in particular. However, as society fully experiences Floridi's Fourth Revolution, and moves into hyper-history (with society dependent on, and defined by, information and communication technologies) and the infosphere (a information environment distinguished by a seamless blend of online and offline information actvity), individuals and societies are dependent on, and formed by, information in an unprecedented way, information overload needs to be taken more seriously than ever. Overload has been claimed to be both the major issue of our time, and a complete non-issue. It has been cited as an important factor in, inter alia, science, medicine, education, politics, governance, business and marketing, planning for smart cities, access to news, personal data tracking, home life, use of social media, and online shopping, and has even influenced literature The information overload phenomenon has been known by many different names, including: information overabundance, infobesity, infoglut, data smog, information pollution, information fatigue, social media fatigue, social media overload, information anxiety, library anxiety, infostress, infoxication, reading overload, communication overload, cognitive overload, information violence, and information assault. There is no single generally accepted definition, but it can best be understood as that situation which arises when there is so much relevant and potentially useful information available that it becomes a hindrance rather than a help. Its essential nature has not changed with changing technology, though its causes and proposed solutions have changed much. The best ways of avoiding overload, individually and socially, appear to lie in a variety of coping strategies, such as filtering, withdrawing, queuing, and 'satisficing'. Better design of information systems, effective personal information management, and the promotion of digital and media literacies, also have a part to play. Overload may perhaps best be overcome by seeking a mindful balance in consuming information, and in finding understanding.","2020-06-01","2024-04-30 06:47:00","2024-05-27 10:46:24","2024-04-30 06:47:00","","","","","","","Information Overload","","","","","Oxford University Press","Oxford","en","","","","","openaccess.city.ac.uk","","DOI: 10.1093/acrefore/9780190228637.013.1360 titleTranslation: 資訊過載：概述","","C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\2B6WPK9R\Bawden 與 Robinson - 2020 - Information Overload An Overview.pdf; C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\VF4C3T4J\23544.html","","資訊超載","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We find that LMs struggle with less popular factual knowledge, and that scaling fails to appreciably improve memorization of factual knowledge in the long tail. We then show that retrieval-augmented LMs largely outperform orders of magnitude larger LMs, while unassisted LMs remain competitive in questions about high-popularity entities. Based on those findings, we devise a simple, yet effective, method for powerful and efficient retrieval-augmented LMs, which retrieves non-parametric memories only when necessary.

Existing methods in this area focus on unsupervised domain adaptation where they have access to the target document collection or supervised (often few-shot) domain adaptation where they additionally have access to (limited) labeled data in the target domain. There also exists research on improving zero-shot performance of retrieval models with no adaptation. This paper introduces a new category of domain adaptation in IR that is as-yet unexplored. Here, similar to the zero-shot setting, we assume the retrieval model does not have access to the target document collection. In contrast, it does have access to a brief textual description that explains the target domain. We define a taxonomy of domain attributes in retrieval tasks to understand different properties of a source domain that can be adapted to a target domain. We introduce a novel automatic data construction pipeline that produces a synthetic document collection, query set, and pseudo relevance labels, given a textual domain description. Extensive experiments on five diverse target domains show that adapting dense retrieval models using the constructed synthetic data leads to effective retrieval performance on the target domain.","2023-07-05","2024-05-02 22:13:25","2024-05-27 10:46:18","2024-05-02 22:13:25","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv","","en","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv:2307.02740 [cs] titleTranslation: 使用目標域描述的密集檢索適應","","C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\EH8JJ58F\Hashemi 等。 - 2023 - Dense Retrieval Adaptation using Target Domain Des.pdf; C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\TMS9965E\2307.html","","未整理; RAG","Computer Science - Computation and Language; Computer Science - Information Retrieval","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2307.02740","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A data recipe is a mixture of data from different sources for training LLMs, which plays a vital role in LLMs' performance. Existing open-source tools for LLM data processing are mostly tailored for specific data recipes. To continuously uncover the potential of LLMs, incorporate data from new sources, and improve LLMs' performance, we build a new system named Data-Juicer, with which we can efficiently generate diverse data recipes, explore different possibilities in forming data mixtures, and evaluate their effects on model performance. Different from traditional data-analytics pipelines, Data-Juicer faces some unique challenges. Firstly, the possible data sources for forming data recipes are truly heterogeneous and massive with various qualities. Secondly, it is extremely expensive to precisely evaluate data recipes' impact on LLMs' performance. Thirdly, the end users of Data-Juicer, model developers, need sufficient flexibility to configure and evaluate different data recipes. Data-Juicer features a fine-grained abstraction of pipelines for constructing data recipes, with over 50 built-in operators for easy composition and extension. By incorporating visualization and auto-evaluation capabilities, Data-Juicer enables a timely feedback loop for both LLM pre-training and fine-tuning. Further, Data-Juicer is optimized and integrated with ecosystems for LLM training, evaluation, and distributed computing.

RAG systems are composed of a retrieval and an LLM based generation module, and provide LLMs with knowledge from a reference textual database, which enables them to act as a natural language layer between a user and textual databases, reducing the risk of hallucinations. Evaluating RAG architectures is, however, challenging because there are several dimensions to consider: the ability of the retrieval system to identify relevant and focused context passages, the ability of the LLM to exploit such passages in a faithful way, or the quality of the generation itself. With RAGAs, we put forward a suite of metrics which can be used to evaluate these different dimensions \textit{without having to rely on ground truth human annotations}. We posit that such a framework can crucially contribute to faster evaluation cycles of RAG architectures, which is especially important given the fast adoption of LLMs.","2023-09-26","2024-05-18 08:09:43","2024-05-27 10:46:12","2024-05-18 08:09:43","","","","","","","RAGAS","","","","","arXiv","","en","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv:2309.15217 [cs] titleTranslation: RAGAS：檢索增強產生的自動評估","","C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\NI8SSY23\Es 等。 - 2023 - RAGAS Automated Evaluation of Retrieval Augmented.pdf; C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\2PCXQBJU\2309.html; D:\Paper\RAGAS： Automated Evaluation of Retrieval Augmented Generation.pdf","","重要; 待讀; LLM; 問答系統; RAG","Computer Science - Computation and Language","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2309.15217","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This inherent cognitive tendency in human thinking contrasts with the formalisms commonly used by computer scientists and technologists, such as relational databases and JSON documents. While these abstractions serve as convenient tools, they only partially align with the intuitive way our brains process information. Relational databases excel in handling structured data and enforcing strict relationships, making them ideal for transaction processing and deterministic analytics. However, their rigid constraints often hinder the exploration of distant connections and answering complex questions about relationships that span multiple layers. This paper focuses on non-relational databases, particularly graph databases, and presents a comprehensive review of Neo4j compared to traditional relational databases. Graph databases offer a more realistic representation of corresponding data, allowing for flexible querying and traversing relationships with ease. By embracing the graph model, we can unlock new insights and uncover hidden patterns within our interconnected world.","2023-07","2024-05-26 19:03:23","2024-05-27 10:46:10","2024-05-26 19:03:23","1-7","","","","","","Comparative Analysis of Relational and Graph Databases for Data Provenance","","","","","","","en","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","titleTranslation: 關係資料庫和圖形資料庫的資料來源比較分析：效能、查詢和安全注意事項","","C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\Q4MALEV5\10235151.html; C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\MWR7W39B\Sunuwar 與 Singh - 2023 - Comparative Analysis of Relational and Graph Datab.pdf","","待讀; 文獻; 圖形資料庫","Resource description framework; Security; Benchmark testing; Search problems; Relational databases; Graph; Neo4j; NoSQL; Social networking (online); W3C","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2023 World Conference on Communication & Computing (WCONF)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Building on a storied tradition of graphs in the AI community, a KG may be simply defined as a directed, labeled, multi-relational graph with some form of semantics. In part, this has been fueled by increased publication of structured datasets on the Web, and well-publicized successes of large-scale projects such as the Google Knowledge Graph and the Amazon Product Graph. However, another factor that is less discussed, but which has been equally instrumental in the success of KGs, is the cross-disciplinary nature of academic KG research. Arguably, because of the diversity of this research, a synthesis of how different KG research strands all tie together could serve a useful role in enabling more ‘moonshot’ research and large-scale collaborations. This review of the KG research landscape attempts to provide such a synthesis by first showing what the major strands of research are, and how those strands map to different communities, such as Natural Language Processing, Databases and Semantic Web. A unified framework is suggested in which to view the distinct, but overlapping, foci of KG research within these communities.","2022-04","2024-05-26 19:20:57","2024-05-27 10:46:09","2024-05-26 19:20:57","161","","4","13","","","Knowledge Graphs","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","www.mdpi.com","","Number: 4 Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute titleTranslation: 知識圖：研究領域的實際回顧","","C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\ZL2CMMGK\Kejriwal - 2022 - Knowledge Graphs A Practical Review of the Resear.pdf","","未整理","natural language processing; graph databases; semantic web; knowledge graphs; knowledge representation; applications; data mining","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An analysis of the compatibility between vector space representations and rules","","","","","https://orca.cardiff.ac.uk/id/eprint/114789/","Recent years have witnessed the successful application of low-dimensional vector space representations of knowledge graphs to predict missing facts or find erroneous ones. However, it is not yet well-understood to what extent ontological knowledge, e.g. given as a set of (existential) rules, can be embedded in a principled way. To address this shortcoming, in this paper we introduce a general framework based on a view of relations as regions, which allows us to study the compatibility between ontological knowledge and different types of vector space embeddings. Our technical contribution is two-fold. First, we show that some of the most popular existing embedding methods are not capable of modelling even very simple types of rules, which in particular also means that they are not able to learn the type of dependencies captured by such rules. Second, we study a model in which relations are modelled as convex regions. We show particular that ontologies which are expressed using so-called quasi-chained existential rules can be exactly represented using convex regions, such that any set of facts which is induced using that vector space embedding is logically consistent and deductively closed with respect to the input ontology.","2018-11-02","2024-05-26 19:54:08","2024-05-27 10:46:06","2024-05-26 19:54:08","","","","","","","From knowledge graph embedding to ontology embedding?","","","","","","Tempe, Arizona","en","","conference","","","","","titleTranslation: 從知識圖嵌入本體嵌入？向量空間表示與規則的兼容性分析","","C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\DM9JKZF6\Gutierrez Basulto 與 Schockaert - 2018 - From knowledge graph embedding to ontology embeddi.pdf; C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\ILMRIE8W\114789.html","","知識本體; 未整理; 知識圖譜","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","16th International Conference on Principles of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In particular, we discuss two fundamentally different kinds of statistical relational models, both of which can scale to massive data sets. The first is based on latent feature models such as tensor factorization and multiway neural networks. The second is based on mining observable patterns in the graph. We also show how to combine these latent and observable models to get improved modeling power at decreased computational cost.

This process, however, is often brittle: even with the same hyperparameter values, distinct random seeds can lead to substantially different results. To better understand this phenomenon, we experiment with four datasets from the GLUE benchmark, fine-tuning BERT hundreds of times on each while varying only the random seeds. We find substantial performance increases compared to previously reported results, and we quantify how the performance of the best-found model varies as a function of the number of fine-tuning trials. Further, we examine two factors influenced by the choice of random seed: weight initialization and training data order. We find that both contribute comparably to the variance of out-of-sample performance, and that some weight initializations perform well across all tasks explored. On small datasets, we observe that many fine-tuning trials diverge part of the way through training, and we offer best practices for practitioners to stop training less promising runs early.

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a promising solution and has been widely adopted. However, a RAG system can involve multiple flexible components, and there is a lack of best practices regarding the optimal RAG setting for various medical purposes. To systematically evaluate such systems, we propose the Medical Information Retrieval-Augmented Generation Evaluation (MIRAGE), a first-of-its-kind benchmark including 7,663 questions from five medical QA datasets. Using MIRAGE, we conducted large-scale experiments with over 1.8 trillion prompt tokens on 41 combinations of different corpora, retrievers, and backbone LLMs through the MedRAG toolkit introduced in this work. Overall, MedRAG improves the accuracy of six different LLMs by up to 18% over chain-of-thought prompting, elevating the performance of GPT-3.5 and Mixtral to GPT-4-level. Our results show that the combination of various medical corpora and retrievers achieves the best performance. In addition, we discovered a log-linear scaling property and the ""lost-in-the-middle"" effects in medical RAG. We believe our comprehensive evaluations can serve as practical guidelines for implementing RAG systems for medicine.","2024-02-23","2024-05-28 23:07:47","2024-05-29 03:34:36","2024-05-28 23:07:47","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv","","en","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv:2402.13178 [cs] titleTranslation: 醫學基準檢索增強生成","","C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\VVAE4EYD\Xiong 等。 - 2024 - Benchmarking Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Me.pdf; C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\6A93SZZ6\2402.html","","未整理; RAG","Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science - Computation and Language","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2402.13178","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

RAG augments the prompt with the external data, while fine-Tuning incorporates the additional knowledge into the model itself. However, the pros and cons of both approaches are not well understood. In this paper, we propose a pipeline for fine-tuning and RAG, and present the tradeoffs of both for multiple popular LLMs, including Llama2-13B, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4. Our pipeline consists of multiple stages, including extracting information from PDFs, generating questions and answers, using them for fine-tuning, and leveraging GPT-4 for evaluating the results. We propose metrics to assess the performance of different stages of the RAG and fine-Tuning pipeline. We conduct an in-depth study on an agricultural dataset. Agriculture as an industry has not seen much penetration of AI, and we study a potentially disruptive application - what if we could provide location-specific insights to a farmer? Our results show the effectiveness of our dataset generation pipeline in capturing geographic-specific knowledge, and the quantitative and qualitative benefits of RAG and fine-tuning. We see an accuracy increase of over 6 p.p. when fine-tuning the model and this is cumulative with RAG, which increases accuracy by 5 p.p. further. In one particular experiment, we also demonstrate that the fine-tuned model leverages information from across geographies to answer specific questions, increasing answer similarity from 47% to 72%. Overall, the results point to how systems built using LLMs can be adapted to respond and incorporate knowledge across a dimension that is critical for a specific industry, paving the way for further applications of LLMs in other industrial domains.","2024-01-30","2024-05-29 02:40:48","2024-05-29 03:34:34","2024-05-29 02:40:48","","","","","","","RAG vs Fine-tuning","","","","","arXiv","","en","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv:2401.08406 [cs] titleTranslation: RAG 與微調：管道、權衡與農業案例研究","","C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\TY67GHP3\Balaguer 等。 - 2024 - RAG vs Fine-tuning Pipelines, Tradeoffs, and a Ca.pdf; C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\5GZKETWA\2401.html","","未整理","Computer Science - Computation and Language; Computer Science - Machine Learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2401.08406","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A RAG system involves finding documents that semantically match a query and then passing the documents to a large language model (LLM) such as ChatGPT to extract the right answer using an LLM. RAG systems aim to: a) reduce the problem of hallucinated responses from LLMs, b) link sources/references to generated responses, and c) remove the need for annotating documents with meta-data. However, RAG systems suffer from limitations inherent to information retrieval systems and from reliance on LLMs. In this paper, we present an experience report on the failure points of RAG systems from three case studies from separate domains: research, education, and biomedical. We share the lessons learned and present 7 failure points to consider when designing a RAG system. The two key takeaways arising from our work are: 1) validation of a RAG system is only feasible during operation, and 2) the robustness of a RAG system evolves rather than designed in at the start. We conclude with a list of potential research directions on RAG systems for the software engineering community.","2024-01-11","2024-05-29 02:59:09","2024-05-29 03:34:31","2024-05-29 02:59:09","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv","","en","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv:2401.05856 [cs] titleTranslation: 設計檢索增強生成系統時的七個故障點","","C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\5BKNYJAG\Barnett 等。 - 2024 - Seven Failure Points When Engineering a Retrieval .pdf; C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\ISVGX6G9\2401.html","","未整理; RAG","Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science - Software Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2401.05856","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Augmenting LMs by retrieving information from external knowledge resources is one promising solution. Most existing retrieval augmented LMs employ a retrieve-and-generate setup that only retrieves information once based on the input. This is limiting, however, in more general scenarios involving generation of long texts, where continually gathering information throughout generation is essential. In this work, we provide a generalized view of active retrieval augmented generation, methods that actively decide when and what to retrieve across the course of the generation. We propose Forward-Looking Active REtrieval augmented generation (FLARE), a generic method which iteratively uses a prediction of the upcoming sentence to anticipate future content, which is then utilized as a query to retrieve relevant documents to regenerate the sentence if it contains low-confidence tokens. We test FLARE along with baselines comprehensively over 4 long-form knowledge-intensive generation tasks/datasets.

In particular, we observe that performance is often highest when relevant information occurs at the beginning or end of the input context, and significantly degrades when models must access relevant information in the middle of long contexts, even for explicitly long-context models.

Notably, chain of thought (CoT) prompting, a recent technique for eliciting complex multi-step reasoning through step-by-step answer examples, achieved the state-of-the-art performances in arithmetics and symbolic reasoning, difficult system-2 tasks that do not follow the standard scaling laws for LLMs. While these successes are often attributed to LLMs' ability for few-shot learning, we show that LLMs are decent zero-shot reasoners by simply adding ""Let's think step by step"" before each answer. Experimental results demonstrate that our Zero-shot-CoT, using the same single prompt template, significantly outperforms zero-shot LLM performances on diverse benchmark reasoning tasks including arithmetics (MultiArith, GSM8K, AQUA-RAT, SVAMP), symbolic reasoning (Last Letter, Coin Flip), and other logical reasoning tasks (Date Understanding, Tracking Shuffled Objects), without any hand-crafted few-shot examples, e.g. increasing the accuracy on MultiArith from 17.7% to 78.7% and GSM8K from 10.4% to 40.7% with large InstructGPT model (text-davinci-002), as well as similar magnitudes of improvements with another off-the-shelf large model, 540B parameter PaLM. The versatility of this single prompt across very diverse reasoning tasks hints at untapped and understudied fundamental zero-shot capabilities of LLMs, suggesting high-level, multi-task broad cognitive capabilities may be extracted by simple prompting. We hope our work not only serves as the minimal strongest zero-shot baseline for the challenging reasoning benchmarks, but also highlights the importance of carefully exploring and analyzing the enormous zero-shot knowledge hidden inside LLMs before crafting finetuning datasets or few-shot exemplars.","2023-01-29","2024-06-24 06:04:05","2024-06-26 23:23:45","2024-06-24 06:04:05","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv","","en","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv:2205.11916 [cs] titleTranslation: 大型語言模型是零樣本推理機","","C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\3J77N9LD\Kojima 等。 - 2023 - Large Language Models are Zero-Shot Reasoners.pdf; C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\EY7G6SNM\2205.html","","LLM; 已整理; COT; Let's think step by step","Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science - Computation and Language; Computer Science - Machine Learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2205.11916","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we show an avenue for creating large amounts of instruction data with varying levels of complexity using LLM instead of humans. Starting with an initial set of instructions, we use our proposed Evol-Instruct to rewrite them step by step into more complex instructions. Then, we mix all generated instruction data to fine-tune LLaMA. We call the resulting model WizardLM. Human evaluations on a complexity-balanced test bed and Vicuna's testset show that instructions from Evol-Instruct are superior to human-created ones. By analyzing the human evaluation results of the high complexity part, we demonstrate that outputs from our WizardLM are preferred to outputs from OpenAI ChatGPT. In GPT-4 automatic evaluation, WizardLM achieves more than 90\% capacity of ChatGPT on 17 out of 29 skills. Even though WizardLM still lags behind ChatGPT in some aspects, our findings suggest that fine-tuning with AI-evolved instructions is a promising direction for enhancing LLMs. Our code and data are public at https://github.com/nlpxucan/WizardLM","2023-06-10","2024-06-24 06:44:00","2024-06-26 23:23:43","2024-06-24 06:44:00","","","","","","","WizardLM","","","","","arXiv","","en","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv:2304.12244 [cs] titleTranslation: WizardLM：讓大型語言模型能夠遵循複雜的指令","","C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\AXYPJ3WR\Xu 等。 - 2023 - WizardLM Empowering Large Language Models to Foll.pdf; C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\2DCBT7DH\2304.html","","LLM; 資料集; 已整理; 問答系統","Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science - Computation and Language","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2304.12244","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), an ad hoc approach that augments LMs with retrieval of relevant knowledge, decreases such issues. However, indiscriminately retrieving and incorporating a fixed number of retrieved passages, regardless of whether retrieval is necessary, or passages are relevant, diminishes LM versatility or can lead to unhelpful response generation. We introduce a new framework called Self-Reflective Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Self-RAG) that enhances an LM's quality and factuality through retrieval and self-reflection. Our framework trains a single arbitrary LM that adaptively retrieves passages on-demand, and generates and reflects on retrieved passages and its own generations using special tokens, called reflection tokens. Generating reflection tokens makes the LM controllable during the inference phase, enabling it to tailor its behavior to diverse task requirements. Experiments show that Self-RAG (7B and 13B parameters) significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLMs and retrieval-augmented models on a diverse set of tasks. Specifically, Self-RAG outperforms ChatGPT and retrieval-augmented Llama2-chat on Open-domain QA, reasoning and fact verification tasks, and it shows significant gains in improving factuality and citation accuracy for long-form generations relative to these models.","2023-10-17","2024-06-24 07:47:06","2024-06-26 23:23:42","2024-06-24 07:47:06","","","","","","","Self-RAG","","","","","arXiv","","en","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv:2310.11511 [cs] titleTranslation: Self-RAG：透過自我反思學習檢索、產生與批判","","C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\SWCFY4G9\Asai 等。 - 2023 - Self-RAG Learning to Retrieve, Generate, and Crit.pdf; C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\QUNJHCKV\2310.html","","LLM; 已整理; 問答系統; RAG","Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science - Computation and Language; Computer Science - Machine Learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2310.11511","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It poses a significant challenge to develop capable AI algorithms for comprehending and grasping a language. As a major approach, language modeling has been widely studied for language understanding and generation in the past two decades, evolving from statistical language models to neural language models. Recently, pre-trained language models (PLMs) have been proposed by pre-training Transformer models over large-scale corpora, showing strong capabilities in solving various NLP tasks. Since researchers have found that model scaling can lead to performance improvement, they further study the scaling effect by increasing the model size to an even larger size. Interestingly, when the parameter scale exceeds a certain level, these enlarged language models not only achieve a significant performance improvement but also show some special abilities that are not present in small-scale language models. To discriminate the difference in parameter scale, the research community has coined the term large language models (LLM) for the PLMs of significant size. Recently, the research on LLMs has been largely advanced by both academia and industry, and a remarkable progress is the launch of ChatGPT, which has attracted widespread attention from society. The technical evolution of LLMs has been making an important impact on the entire AI community, which would revolutionize the way how we develop and use AI algorithms. In this survey, we review the recent advances of LLMs by introducing the background, key findings, and mainstream techniques. In particular, we focus on four major aspects of LLMs, namely pre-training, adaptation tuning, utilization, and capacity evaluation.

By leveraging the wealth of information contained within knowledge graphs, it is possible to greatly enhance various downstream tasks, making reasoning over knowledge graphs an area of increasing interest. However, despite its popularity, knowledge graph reasoning remains a challenging problem. The first major challenge of knowledge graph reasoning lies in the nature of knowledge graphs themselves. Most knowledge graphs are incomplete, meaning that they may not capture all the relevant knowledge required for reasoning. As a result, reasoning on incomplete knowledge graphs can be difficult. Additionally, real-world knowledge graphs often evolve over time, which presents an additional challenge. The second challenge of knowledge graph reasoning pertains to the input data. In some KG reasoning applications, users may be unfamiliar with the background knowledge graph, leading to the possibility of asking ambiguous questions that can make KG reasoning tasks more challenging. Moreover, some applications require iterative reasoning, where users ask several related questions in sequence, further increasing the complexity of the task. The third challenge of knowledge graph reasoning concerns the algorithmic aspect. Due to the varied properties of relations in knowledge graphs, such as transitivity, symmetry, and asymmetry, designing an all-round KG reasoning model that fits all these properties can be challenging. Furthermore, most KG reasoning models tend to focus on solving a specific problem, lacking the generalization ability required to apply to other tasks. This tutorial aims to comprehensively review different aspects of knowledge graph reasoning applications and highlight open challenges and future directions. It is intended to benefit researchers and practitioners in the fields of data mining, artificial intelligence, and social science.","2023-08-04","2024-07-09 23:09:52","2024-07-09 23:10:06","2024-07-09","5813–5814","","","","","","","KDD '23","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","en","","","","","ACM Digital Library","","","","false","","知識推理; 知識圖譜; 已整理","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Early works in this domain mainly focus on static KGR, and recent works try to leverage the temporal and multi-modal information, which are more practical and closer to real-world. However, no survey papers and open-source repositories comprehensively summarize and discuss models in this important direction.

Despite this success, these models can learn, perpetuate, and amplify harmful social biases. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of bias evaluation and mitigation techniques for LLMs. We first consolidate, formalize, and expand notions of social bias and fairness in natural language processing, defining distinct facets of harm and introducing several desiderata to operationalize fairness for LLMs. We then unify the literature by proposing three intuitive taxonomies, two for bias evaluation, namely metrics and datasets, and one for mitigation. Our first taxonomy of metrics for bias evaluation disambiguates the relationship between metrics and evaluation datasets, and organizes metrics by the different levels at which they operate in a model: embeddings, probabilities, and generated text. Our second taxonomy of datasets for bias evaluation categorizes datasets by their structure as counterfactual inputs or prompts, and identifies the targeted harms and social groups; we also release a consolidation of publicly-available datasets for improved access. Our third taxonomy of techniques for bias mitigation classifies methods by their intervention during pre-processing, in-training, intra-processing, and post-processing, with granular subcategories that elucidate research trends. Finally, we identify open problems and challenges for future work. Synthesizing a wide range of recent research, we aim to provide a clear guide of the existing literature that empowers researchers and practitioners to better understand and prevent the propagation of bias in LLMs.","2023-09-02","2024-07-10 00:19:27","2024-07-10 00:19:45","2024-07-10 00:19:27","","","","","","","Bias and Fairness in Large Language Models","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","","","C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\ZBPRTVZ6\Gallegos 等。 - 2023 - Bias and Fairness in Large Language Models A Surv.pdf","","機器學習; LLM; 已整理; 文獻; 偏見","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A common approach for knowledge-intensive tasks is to employ a retrieve-then-read pipeline that first retrieves a handful of relevant contextual documents from an external corpus such as Wikipedia and then predicts an answer conditioned on the retrieved documents. In this paper, we present a novel perspective for solving knowledge-intensive tasks by replacing document retrievers with large language model generators. We call our method generate-then-read (GenRead), which first prompts a large language model to generate contextutal documents based on a given question, and then reads the generated documents to produce the final answer. Furthermore, we propose a novel clustering-based prompting method that selects distinct prompts, resulting in the generated documents that cover different perspectives, leading to better recall over acceptable answers. We conduct extensive experiments on three different knowledge-intensive tasks, including open-domain QA, fact checking, and dialogue system. Notably, GenRead achieves 71.6 and 54.4 exact match scores on TriviaQA and WebQ, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art retrieve-then-read pipeline DPR-FiD by +4.0 and +3.9, without retrieving any documents from any external knowledge source. Lastly, we demonstrate the model performance can be further improved by combining retrieval and generation.

Retrieval-augmented large language models have raised extensive attention for grounding model generation on external knowledge. However, retrievers struggle to capture relevance, especially for queries with complex information needs. Recent work has proposed to improve relevance modeling by having large language models actively involved in retrieval, i.e., to improve retrieval with generation. In this paper, we show that strong performance can be achieved by a method we call Iter-RetGen, which synergizes retrieval and generation in an iterative manner. A model output shows what might be needed to finish a task, and thus provides an informative context for retrieving more relevant knowledge which in turn helps generate a better output in the next iteration. Compared with recent work which interleaves retrieval with generation when producing an output, Iter-RetGen processes all retrieved knowledge as a whole and largely preserves the flexibility in generation without structural constraints. We evaluate Iter-RetGen on multi-hop question answering, fact verification, and commonsense reasoning, and show that it can flexibly leverage parametric knowledge and non-parametric knowledge, and is superior to or competitive with state-of-the-art retrieval-augmented baselines while causing fewer overheads of retrieval and generation. We can further improve performance via generation-augmented retrieval adaptation.","2023-10-23","2024-07-14 05:32:47","2024-07-14 14:00:13","2024-07-14 05:32:47","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv","","en","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv:2305.15294 [cs]","","C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\QCFRIASG\Shao 等。 - 2023 - Enhancing Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Model.pdf; C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\3AXGX3TW\2305.html","","已整理; 重要; RAG","Computer Science - Computation and Language","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2305.15294","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

RAG has become increasingly important for Generative AI solutions, especially in enterprise settings or in any domain in which knowledge is constantly refreshed and cannot be memorized in the LLM. We argue here that the retrieval component of RAG systems, be it dense or sparse, deserves increased attention from the research community, and accordingly, we conduct the first comprehensive and systematic examination of the retrieval strategy of RAG systems. We focus, in particular, on the type of passages IR systems within a RAG solution should retrieve. Our analysis considers multiple factors, such as the relevance of the passages included in the prompt context, their position, and their number. One counter-intuitive finding of this work is that the retriever's highest-scoring documents that are not directly relevant to the query (e.g., do not contain the answer) negatively impact the effectiveness of the LLM. Even more surprising, we discovered that adding random documents in the prompt improves the LLM accuracy by up to 35%. These results highlight the need to investigate the appropriate strategies when integrating retrieval with LLMs, thereby laying the groundwork for future research in this area.","2024-07-10","2024-07-15 05:48:13","2024-07-15 05:48:34","2024-07-15 05:48:13","719-729","","","","","","The Power of Noise","","","","","","","en","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv:2401.14887 [cs]","","C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\5DM6EVX3\Cuconasu 等。 - 2024 - The Power of Noise Redefining Retrieval for RAG S.pdf; C:\Users\BlackCat\Zotero\storage\S3WBMTMS\2401.html","","已整理; 文獻; 低解釋性; 排序; LLM; RAG","Computer Science - Computation and Language; Computer Science - Information Retrieval","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The variables concerned are within-document term frequency, document length, and within-query term frequency. Simple weighting functions are developed, and tested on the TREC test collection. Considerable performance improvements (over simple inverse collection frequency weighting) are demonstrated.","1994","2024-07-15 09:26:59","2024-07-15 09:26:59","","232-241","","","","","","","","","","","Springer","London","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","","","Croft, Bruce W.; van Rijsbergen, C.

While recent efforts have focuses on connecting LLMs with external knowledge sources, the integration of knowledge bases (KBs) remains understudied and faces several challenges. In this paper, we introduce KnowledGPT, a comprehensive framework to bridge LLMs with various knowledge bases, facilitating both the retrieval and storage of knowledge. The retrieval process employs the program of thought prompting, which generates search language for KBs in code format with pre-defined functions for KB operations. Besides retrieval, KnowledGPT offers the capability to store knowledge in a personalized KB, catering to individual user demands. With extensive experiments, we show that by integrating LLMs with KBs, KnowledGPT properly answers a broader range of questions requiring world knowledge compared with vanilla LLMs, utilizing both knowledge existing in widely-known KBs and extracted into personalized KBs.","2023-08-17","2024-07-15 07:59:13","2024-07-16 07:49:14","2024-07-15 07:59:13","","","","","","","KnowledGPT","","","","","arXiv","","en","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv:2308.11761 [cs]","","","","","Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science - Computation and Language","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2308.11761","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
